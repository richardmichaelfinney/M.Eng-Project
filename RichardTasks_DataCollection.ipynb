       "  'Abstract': 'The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) that is embedded in the foramen of the cervical vertebra can be injured during a whiplash motion. A potential cause is that whilst the neck bends in the whiplash motion, the changes of spinal canal volume induce impulsive pressure transients in the venous blood outside the dura mater (DM) and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inside the DM. The fluids can dynamically interact with the DRG and DM, which are deformable. In this work, the interaction is investigated numerically using a strong-coupling partitioned method that synchronize the computations of the fluid and structure. It is found that the interaction includes two basic processes, i.e., the pulling and pressing processes. In the pulling process, the DRG is stretched towards the spinal canal, and the venous blood is driven into the canal via the foramen. This process results from negative pressure in the fluids. In contrast, the pressing process is caused by positive pressure that leads to compression of the DRG and the outflow of the venous blood from the canal. The largest pressure gradient is observed at the foramen, where the DRG is located at. The DRG is subject to prominent von Mises stress near its end, which is fixed without motions. The negative internal pressure is more efficient to deform the DRG than the positive internal pressure. This indicates that the most hazardous condition for the DRG is the pulling process.',\n",

The immune status of the patient and the early and correct therapeutic approach are the main factors that predict disease advancement. The new antiretroviral therapies improve the CD4 cell count and permit to treat these patients as immuno-competent. The local approach with antifungal drugs instillations, percutaneous drainage combined with systemic antifungal therapy can increase the number of patients that may benefit from a conservative treatment. We report a case of a 44-year-old homosexual patient with AIDS since 1991 in stage IVc (CDC--Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) in antiretroviral treatment. In September 1999 he came because of left low back pain. Laboratory data showed leucocytosis. Urinalysis revealed the presence of white and red blood cells and a negative urine culture. The abdominal ultrasound examination, the intravenous pyelogram and finally the computerized tomography confirm the presence of solid material that occupied the renal pelvis and the middle and superior caliceal group of the left kidney associated with lymph nodes enlargement. An echo-guided needle aspiration allowed us to identify Aspergillus fumigatus. Local instillations with amfotericina B through a nephrostomy and systemic antifungal drugs resolved the urinary infection.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Over the past years, clonal tracking has gained the center stage as a unique technology capable to unveil population dynamics and hierarchical relationships in vivo. We here highlighted the main open questions related to the in vivo clonal behavior of hematopoietic cells with a particular focus on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and T cells as main targets of cell- and gene-therapies. We walked through the current methods applied for tracing in vivo dynamics and functions of hematopoietic cells in animal models and we described the results of early studies conducted on humans. We specifically focused our attention on the recent use of retroviral/lentiviral vector Integration Site (IS) analyses to follow stably marked clones and their progeny in vivo. We showed how this molecular tracking method can be successfully employed in human studies to unveil the clonal behavior of hematopoietic cells, describing pioneering works conducted on samples from gene therapy treated patients. Clonal tracking through IS identification still comes with a complex wet-experimental protocol and technical/analytical constraints. In this regard, we reviewed the features of the available computational tools for the identification and quantification of ISs and we highlighted the potential future improvements of IS-based tracking, as this technology is becoming a major source of information on in vivo fate and survival of engineered cells in humans.',\n",

The synthesis of stable, efficient, non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for OER has been a long-standing challenge. In this work, a facile and scalable method to synthesize hollow and conductive iron-cobalt phosphide (Fe-Co-P) alloy nanostructures using an Fe-Co metal organic complex as a precursor is described. The Fe-Co-P alloy exhibits excellent OER activity with a specific current density of 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> being achieved at an overpotential as low as 252 mV. The current density at 1.5 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) of the Fe-Co-P catalyst is 30.7 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is more than 3 orders of magnitude greater than that obtained with state-of-the-art Fe-Co oxide catalysts. Our mechanistic experiments and theoretical analysis suggest that the electrochemical-induced high-valent iron stabilizes the cobalt in a low-valent state, leading to the simultaneous enhancement of activity and stability of the OER catalyst.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Bone size (BS) variation is under strong genetic control and plays an important role in determining bone strength and fracture risk. Recently, a genome-wide association study identified polymorphisms associated with hip BS variation in the PLCL1 (phospholipase c-like 1) locus. Carriers of the major A allele of the most significant polymorphism, rs7595412, have around 17% larger hip BS than non-carriers. We therefore hypothesized that this polymorphism may also influence postmenopausal complications. The effects of rs7595412 on hip BS, bone mineral density (BMD), vertebral fractures, serum Crosslaps and osteocalcin levels were analyzed in 1,191 postmenopausal Danish women. This polymorphism had no influence on hip and spine BS as well as on femur and spine BMD. Women carrying at least one copy of the A allele had lower levels of serum osteocalcin as compared with those homozygous for the G allele (p = 0.03) whereas no effect on serum Crosslaps was detected. Furthermore, women homozygous for the A allele were more affected by vertebral fractures than those carrying at least one copy of the G allele (p = 0.04). In postmenopausal women, our results suggest that the PLCL1 rs7595412 polymorphism has no obvious effect on hip BS or BMD but may be nominally associated with increased proportion of vertebral fracture and increased levels of osteocalcin.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Immunohistochemical analysis using paraffin-embedded specimens is the method of choice to evaluate protein expression at a cellular level while preserving tissue architecture in normal and neoplastic tissues. Current knowledge of the expression of terminal differentiation markers in the mouse mammary gland relies on the evaluation of frozen tissues by use of immunofluorescence. We assessed changes in patterns of expression of terminal differentiation markers throughout the development of the mouse mammary gland in paraffin-embedded tissues. The expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) and keratins (K) 5, 8/18, and 14 was influenced by the development stage of the mammary gland. Expression of K5 and SMA was restricted to basal cells. Keratin 14 was consistently expressed by mammary basal cells, and was detected in scattered luminal cells from 13.5 days after conception through puberty. Labeling for K8/18 of luminal cells was heterogeneous at all times. Heterogeneous expression patterns in luminal cells suggest this layer has cells with a variety of biological functions. The absence of K6 expression at any stage of the development of the mammary gland was confirmed by use of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, which indicates that this intermediate filament is not a marker of the mammary gland stem cell. Finally, consistent with results of earlier studies, keratins 1, 10, 13, and 15, and filaggrin, involucrin, and loricrin were not detected at any stage of mammary gland development.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Compound K (CK) is one of the major metabolites of ginsenosides exhibiting a variety of pharmacological properties such as anti-ageing, anti-oxidation and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the protective efficacy of CK in abnormal skin conditions with inflammatory responses was not examined. Here, we investigated the effects of CK on matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and type I procollagen production in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-stimulated human skin fibroblasts HS68 cells and human skin equivalents. We found that CK suppressed MMP-1 secretion and increased the level of reduced type I procollagen secretion, caused by the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, but not p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation in TNF-α-stimulated HS68 cells. Then, we focused on the involvement of the c-Src and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as upstream signalling molecules for ERK activation by TNF-α in HS68 cells. CK suppressed the phosphorylation of c-Src/EGFR by TNF-α, which led to the inactivation of downstream signalling molecules including AKT and MEK. In addition, CK suppressed AP-1 (c-jun and c-fos) phosphorylation as downstream transcription factors of active ERK for MMP-1 expression in TNFα-stimulated HS68 cells. These results showed novel mechanisms by which CK inhibits TNF-α-induced MMP-1 expression through the inactivation of c-Src/EGFR-dependent ERK/AP-1 signalling pathway, resulting in the inhibition of collagen degradation in human fibroblast cells. Therefore, CK may be a promising protective agent for the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions such as skin ageing and atopic dermatitis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Azole anions are key components in CO₂ capture materials that include ionic liquids and porous solids. Herein, we use density functional theory (DFT) and a Langmuir-type adsorption model to study azole anion-CO₂ interactions. Linear CO₂ has to be bent by approximately 45° to form an N-C bond within the azole ring. The energy cost of bending renders CO₂ absorption much more difficult compared to SO₂ absorption. For different azole anions, the number of nitrogen atoms in the ring and the natural bond orbital energy of the reacting nitrogen lone pair, both linearly correlate with the calculated reaction enthalpy and are useful handles for new sorbent designs. Unlike for SO₂, the azole parent architecture (unsubstituted) does not allow successive CO₂ absorption under mild conditions (<0.12 MPa and at room temperature). Experimental CO₂ and SO₂ absorption isotherms are reproduced by using the Langmuir model parameterized with the calibrated DFT reaction enthalpies. This study provides insight for designing azole-based CO₂-capture materials.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'CD8+ T cell recognition of polymorphic wild-type sequence p53(65-73) peptides in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The TP53 tumor suppressor gene contains a well-studied polymorphism that encodes either proline (P) or arginine (R) at codon 72, and over half of the world\\'s population is homozygous for R at this codon. The wild-type sequence (wt) p53 peptide, p53(65-73), has been identified as a CD8+ T cell-defined tumor antigen for use in broadly applicable cancer vaccines. However, depending on the TP53 codon 72 polymorphism of the recipient, the induced responses to the peptides incorporating R (p53(72R)) or P (p53(72P)) can be \"self\" or \"non-self.\" Thus, we sought to determine which wt p53(65-73) peptide should be used in wt p53-based cancer vaccines. Despite similar predicted HLA-A2-binding affinities, the p53(72P) peptide was more efficient than the p53(72R) peptide in HLA-A2 stabilization assays. In vitro stimulation (IVS) of CD8+ T cells obtained from healthy HLA-A2(+) donors with these two peptides led to the generation of CD8+ T cell effectors in one-third of the samples tested, at a frequency similar to the responsiveness to other wt p53 peptides. Interestingly, regardless of their p53 codon 72 genotype, CD8+ T cells stimulated with either p53(72P) or p53(72R) peptide were cross-reactive against T2 cells pulsed with either peptide, as well as HLA-A2(+) head and neck cancer (HNC) cell lines presenting p53(72P) and/or p53(72R) peptides for T cell recognition. Therefore, the cross-reactivity of CD8+ T cells for the polymorphic wt p53(65-73) peptides, irrespective of their p53 codon 72 polymorphism, suggests that employing either peptide in wt p53-based vaccines can result in efficient targeting of this epitope.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Renal osteodystrophy encompasses the bone histologic abnormalities seen in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bALP) isoform B1x is exclusively found in serum of some patients with CKD. The aim of this cross-sectional diagnostic test study was to examine the relationship between serum bALP isoform activity and histomorphometric parameters of bone in patients with CKD receiving maintenance hemodialysis. Anterior iliac crest bone biopsy samples from 40 patients with CKD were selected on the basis of bone turnover for histomorphometric analysis. There were samples from 20 patients with low and 20 with non-low bone turnover. In serum, bALP, bALP isoforms (B/I, B1x, B1, and B2), and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were measured. Low bone turnover was defined by mineral apposition rate\\xa0< 0.36μm/d. Non-low bone turnover was defined by mineral apposition rate\\xa0≥ 0.36μm/d. PTH. B1x was found in 21 patients (53%) who had lower median levels of bALP, 18.6 versus 46.9U/L; B/I, 0.10 versus 0.22 μkat/L; B1, 0.40 versus 0.88 μkat/L; B2, 1.21 versus 2.66 μkat/L; and PTH, 49 versus 287pg/mL, compared with patients without B1x (P<0.001). 13 patients (65%) with low bone turnover and 8 patients (40%) with non-low bone turnover (P<0.2) had detectable B1x. B1x correlated inversely with histomorphometric parameters of bone turnover. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that B1x can be used for the diagnosis of low bone turnover (area under the curve [AUC], 0.83), whereas bALP (AUC, 0.89) and PTH (AUC, 0.85) are useful for the diagnosis of non-low bone turnover. Small number of study participants. Requirement of high-performance liquid chromatography methods for measurement of B1x. B1x, PTH, and bALP have similar diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing low from non-low bone turnover.

       "  'Abstract': \"There is minimal evidence on the extent to which the occurrence of a severe acute exacerbation of COPD that results in hospitalization affects the subsequent disease course. Previous studies on this topic did not generate causally-interpretable estimates. Our aim was to use corrected methodology to update previously reported estimates of the associations between previous and future exacerbations in these patients. Using administrative health data in British Columbia, Canada (1997-2012), we constructed a cohort of patients with at least one severe exacerbation, defined as an episode of inpatient care with the main diagnosis of COPD based on international classification of diseases (ICD) codes. We applied a random-effects 'joint frailty' survival model that is particularly developed for the analysis of recurrent events in the presence of competing risk of death and heterogeneity among individuals in their rate of events. Previous severe exacerbations entered the model as dummy-coded time-dependent covariates, and the model was adjusted for several observable patient and disease characteristics. 35,994 individuals (mean age at baseline 73.7, 49.8% female, average follow-up 3.21 years) contributed 34,271 severe exacerbations during follow-up. The first event was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.75 (95%CI 1.69-1.82) for the risk of future severe exacerbations. This risk decreased to HR = 1.36 (95%CI 1.30-1.42) for the second event and to 1.18 (95%CI 1.12-1.25) for the third event. The first two severe exacerbations that occurred during follow-up were also significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. There was substantial heterogeneity in the individual-specific rate of severe exacerbations. Even after adjusting for observable characteristics, individuals in the 97.5th percentile of exacerbation rate had 5.6 times higher rate of severe exacerbations than those in the 2.5th percentile. Using robust statistical methodology that controlled for heterogeneity in exacerbation rates among individuals, we demonstrated potential causal associations among past and future severe exacerbations, albeit the magnitude of association was noticeably lower than previously reported. The prevention of severe exacerbations has the potential to modify the disease trajectory.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We report our results of truncus arteriosus surgical reparation in a period of 10 years. From January 1993 to November 2003, 17 patients were operated with a median age and weight of 66 days and 3.5 kg respectively. According to the Van Praagh classification there were 13 cases of type A1, 2 cases of type A2 and 2 cases of A4. The connection between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery was performed by a homograft (n = 12), a Contegra tube (n = 1) or a Barbero-Marcial intervention (n = 4). In one case, a plasty of the truncus was performed. Patients were classified in two groups: group A for those operated between 1993 and 1997 (n = 8) and group B for those operated after 1997 (n = 9). Five patients died (29%) in the post-operative period, 4 in the group A (50%) and one in group B (11%). The mean duration of intensive care stay was 12.2 (+ 7.4) days. Statistical analysis did not reveal any difference between both groups, especially concerning post-operative treatment or prognosis. In the multivariate analysis, an age below 30 days was a risk factor of post-operative death (OR = 16.5, 95% CI = 1.09 - 250; p = 0.043). After a mean follow-up of 3.9 (+ 3.5) years, 2 patients required a redo intervention for replacement of the pulmonary artery homograft. All 12 suvivors are asymptomatic without any pulmonary hypertension. In conclusion, the results of surgical reparation of the truncus arteriosus seem to improve with experience. According to recent progresses in surgery and intensive care, the intervention can be scheduled beyond the neonatal period without additive risk and with potentially less consecutive redo interventions.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Psychotic disorders in childhood and early adolescence often progress to chronic schizophrenia, but in many cases there are diagnosable medical and genetic causes or risk factors. We reviewed our clinical experience and the relevant literature to identify these factors and to define their clinical features, appropriate work-up and treatment. We reviewed the results of comprehensive medical evaluations of 160 psychotic children and adolescents in our center. We also searched the Medline database (January 1994 to December 2015) with the following keywords and combinations: early onset schizophrenia, childhood onset schizophrenia, early onset psychosis, first episode psychosis, inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), genetic syndrome, copy number variants, autoimmune disorders, endocrine diseases, nutritional deficiencies, central nervous system infections, movement disorders, and epilepsy. In our center, 12.5% of cases had medical disorders likely to be contributing to psychosis. Based on 66 relevant papers and our experience, we describe the clinical features of multiple genetic syndromes, IEM, and autoimmune, neurological, endocrinological and nutritional disorders that increase the risk of psychotic disorders in childhood and adolescence. We propose an algorithm for systematic laboratory evaluation, informed by clinical examination, emphasizing common and/or treatable factors. In children and early adolescents with psychotic disorders, systematic medical work-up is warranted to identify medical and genetic factors. Not every rare cause can be worked up, thus careful clinical examinations are required to detect medical, neurological and genetic signs.

The present study is a network meta-analysis comparing all the interventions available to prevent AMS. Electronic databases were searched for randomized clinical trials evaluating the use of drugs to prevent AMS. Incidence of AMS was the primary outcome and incidence of severe AMS, paraesthesia (as side effect of acetazolamide use), headache and severe headache, and oxygen saturation were the secondary outcomes. Odds ratio [95% confidence interval] was the effect estimate for categorical outcomes and weighted mean difference for oxygen saturation. Random effects model was used to derive the direct and mixed treatment comparison pooled estimates. Trial sequential analysis and grading of the evidence for key comparisons were carried out. A total of 24 studies were included. Acetazolamide at 125, 250 and 375\\u2009mg twice daily, dexamethasone and ibuprofen had statistically significant lower incidence of AMS compared to placebo. All the above agents except ibuprofen were also observed to significantly reduce the incidence of severe AMS. Acetazolamide alone or in combination with Ginkgo biloba were associated with lower incidence of headache, but higher risk of paraesthesia. Acetazolamide at 125\\u2009mg and 375\\u2009mg twice daily significantly reduce the incidence of severe headache as like ibuprofen. Trial sequential analysis indicates that the current evidence is adequate for the incidence of AMS only for acetazolamide 125 and 250\\u2009mg twice daily. Similarly, the strength of evidence for acetazolamide 125 and 250\\u2009mg twice daily was moderate while it was either low or very low for all other comparisons. Acetazolamide at 125, 250 and 375\\u2009mg twice daily, ibuprofen and dexamethasone significantly reduce the incidence of AMS of which adequate evidence exists only for acetazolamide 125 and 250\\u2009mg twice daily therapy. Acetazolamide 125\\u2009mg twice daily could be the best in the pool considering the presence of enough evidence for preventing AMS and associated with lower incidence of paraesthesia.

The southern African countries of Zimbabwe and South Africa, however, are known to sustain a great diversity of lyssaviruses, with large biological variations amongst genotype 1 (rabies viruses) at present more apparent here than elsewhere on the continent. One recognized biotype of rabies virus in the subcontinent appears to be specifically adapted to a variety of mongooses, belonging to the Viverrinae subfamily (family Herpestidae) and are commonly referred to as viverrid viruses, although the term mongoose rabies would be more correct, considering the taxonomic status of the host species involved. It was our objective to study the genetic relationships of 77 rabies virus isolates of this mongoose biotype, isolated in South Africa and Zimbabwe, towards elucidation of the molecular epidemiology of this interesting group of African viruses. In our study of a 592 nucleotide sequence encompassing the cytoplasmic domain of the glycoprotein and the G-L intergenic region of the viral genomes, we provide the first comprehensive data on the molecular epidemiology of these viruses and indicate a history of extended evolutionary adaptation in this geographical domain. The molecular epidemiological observations reported here are highly unlikely to be limited to the small geographical areas of South Africa and Zimbabwe and illustrate the need for lyssavirus surveillance in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa and throughout the entire continent.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"<i><b>Background.</b></i> Different surgical variables are assumed to play a role in postoperative course after lower third molar extraction. The aim of study was to assess whether flap design and duration of surgery can influence acute postoperative symptoms and signs after lower third molar extraction. <i><b>Methods.</b></i> Twenty-five patients scheduled for lower third molar extraction were included in this study and randomly assigned to two groups in terms of flap design: group A (envelope flap) and group B (triangular flap). Swelling and trismus were assessed before and after surgery on days 0, 2 and 7. Pain was assessed for seven days after surgery. Maximum postoperative pain was chosen as the main outcome variable. ANOVA was used to assess differences between the groups regarding maximum postoperative pain, trismus and swelling at 2- and 7-day intervals. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to assess correlation between duration of surgery and postoperative symptoms and signs. <i><b>Results.</b></i> No significant difference was found between the two flap designs for any postoperative symptoms and signs. The duration of surgery was found to be correlated with both trismus (r = -0.44, P = 0.04) and swelling (r = 0.59, P = 0.004) as assessed 2 days after surgery. No associations were found between duration of surgery and maximum postoperative pain and trismus and swelling at 7-day interval. <i><b>Conclusion.</b></i> Within the limits of the present study, the duration of surgery, and not the flap design, affected the acute postoperative symptoms and signs after lower third molar extraction.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Previous studies have shown that retinal input plays an important role in the development of interhemispheric callosal connections, but little is known about the role retinal input plays on the development of ipsilateral striate-extrastriate connections and the interplay that might exist between developing ipsilateral and callosal pathways. We analyzed the effects of bilateral enucleation performed at different ages on both the distribution of extrastriate projections originating from restricted loci in medial, acallosal striate cortex, and the overall pattern of callosal connections revealed following multiple tracer injections. As in normal rats, striate-extrastriate projections in rats enucleated at birth consisted of multiple, well-defined fields that were largely confined to acallosal regions throughout extrastriate cortex. However, these projections were highly irregular and variable, and they tended to occupy correspondingly anomalous and variable acallosal regions. Moreover, area 17, but not area 18a, was smaller in enucleates compared to controls, resulting in an increase in the divergence of striate projections. Anomalies in patterns of striate-extrastriate projections were not observed in rats enucleated at postnatal day (P)6, although the size of area 17 was still reduced in these rats. These results indicate that the critical period during which the eyes influence the development of striate-extrastriate, but not the size of striate cortex, ends by P6. Finally, enucleation did not change the time course and definition of the initial invasion of axons into gray matter, suggesting that highly variable striate projections patterns do not result from anomalous pruning of exuberant distributions of 17-18a fibers in gray matter.',\n",

Retrospective, case-controlled study. Academic referral center. Fifteen patients, all of whom had pemphigus vulgaris, were included in the analysis. The group comprised all patients with pemphigus vulgaris seen during 11.5 years who did not initially respond to low doses (< 40 mg/d) of prednisone and who were followed up for at least 500 days after beginning treatment. One group received very high-dose intravenous pulse(s) of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (Solu-Medrol) (n = 9). The other group did not receive intravenous pulse therapy (n = 6). Glucocorticoid dose and status of disease. Patients treated with pulse therapy and control patients treated with conventional oral prednisone had similar initial disease severity. Six of the 9 patients who received pulse therapy showed improvement of their pemphigus vulgaris, and 4 of the 9 had discontinued all glucocorticoids and were in remission at mean (+/- SEM) 269 +/- 27 days. They have continued in remission without receiving prednisone for a mean of 714 +/- 142 days. Therapeutic benefit was seen in patients who received pulse therapy early or late after beginning glucocorticoid therapy. In contrast, none of the 6 control patients has achieved long-term remissions without therapy. All of the controls have had long courses of glucocorticoid therapy, with a mean of 1467 +/- 112 days of prednisone treatment. Overall, the mean (+/- SEM) prednisone dose between days 350 and 500 from onset of glucocorticoid therapy was 9.2 +/- 4.2 mg/d for those who received pulse therapy vs 21.0 +/- 3.3 mg/d (P < .05) for those who did not (unpaired 2-tailed t test). High-dose pulse administration of glucocorticoids is a potentially effective therapy to be considered in the treatment of patients with severe pemphigus vulgaris. Similar patients treated with conventional orally administered doses of prednisone had protracted courses requiring years of glucocorticoid therapy with no long-term remissions.',\n",

A total of 35 hands of 26 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome were divided into 2 groups. Static volar wrist splints were applied to 16 hands in the control group, and these patients were trained to modify their functional activities in accordance with conservative treatment. In the experimental group, nerve gliding exercises were applied to 19 hands that were also treated conservatively. A day-and-night splint, together with the conservative training program, was applied for 6 weeks to both groups. Subsequently, a night splint only was used in both groups, and nerve gliding exercises were continued in the experimental group for the remaining 4 weeks. Pretreatment and posttreatment assessments of pain, sensation, muscle strength, and grip and pinch strength, along with Tinel and Phalen tests, were performed in all cases; electrophysiologic measurements were recorded. Significant progress was detected in both control and experimental groups during the posttreatment phase compared with the initial phase (P < .05). However, when the 2 groups were compared, the experimental group in which nerve gliding exercises were added to conservative therapy approaches demonstrated more rapid pain reduction; these patients also showed greater functional improvement, especially in grip strength (P < .05).',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with dismal prognosis. The tumor microenvironment is composed by multiple cell types, molecular factors, and extracellular matrix forming a strong desmoplastic reaction, which is a hallmark of the disease. A complex cross-talk between tumor cells and the stroma exists with reciprocal influence that dictates tumor progression and ultimately the clinical outcome. In this context, tumor infiltrating immune cells through secretion of chemokine and cytokines exert an important regulatory role. Here we review the correlation between the immune infiltrates, evaluated on tumor samples of pancreatic cancer patients underwent surgical resection, and disease free and/or overall survival after surgery. Specifically, we focus on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), mast cells (MCs) and macrophages that all contribute to a Th2-type inflammatory and immunosuppressive microenvironment. In these patients tumor immune infiltrates not only do not contribute to disease eradication but rather the features of Th2-type inflammation and immunosuppression is significantly associated with more rapid disease progression and reduced survival.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Formation of Shc-Grb2 complexes is necessary to induce neoplastic transformation by overexpression of Shc proteins.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The mammalian SHC gene encodes three overlapping proteins which all contain a carboxy-terminal SH2 domain. Shc proteins are phosphorylated on tyrosine by a variety of receptor and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. Phosphorylated Shc proteins form a complex with the SH2-SH3 containing Grb2 protein which is implicated in the regulation of Ras, suggesting that Shc is involved in the intracellular transmission of growth signals from activated tyrosine kinases to Ras. Overexpression of Shc proteins in cultured fibroblasts induces a transformed phenotype. We now report that, in vitro, the high affinity binding of Grb2 to Shc proteins requires phosphorylation of Shc at Tyr317, which lies within the high affinity binding motif for the Grb2 SH2 domain, pYVNV, where Asn at the +2 position is crucial for complex formation. In vivo, Tyr317 is the major, but not the only, site for Shc phosphorylation, and is the sole Shc high affinity binding site for Grb2. Mutant Shc proteins with substitution of the Tyr317 by Phe lose the capacity to be highly phosphorylated on tyrosine upon growth factor receptor activation, to bind Grb2 and to induce neoplastic transformation. In contrast, Shc proteins that have an extensive aminoterminal deletion, but retain the Tyr317 site and the SH2 domain conserve the capacity to be phosphorylated, to bind to Grb2 and to induce cell transformation. These data indicate that the formation of the Shc-Grb2 complex is a crucial event in the transformation induced by overexpression of Shc and support the notion that Shc proteins can deliver activation signals to RAS.',\n",

The project was piloted in 3 rural hospitals where CPD activities were failing to meet demand because activities were not properly coordinated, the meetings were too infrequent, the delivery methods were inappropriate, and the content was highly supply-driven and generally irrelevant to the performance needs of the health workers. The project intervention involved the installation of various ICT equipment including computers, liquid crystal display (LCD) projectors, office copiers, printers, spiral binders and CDs. A number of health workers were also trained in ICT use. Three years later, an evaluation study was conducted using interviews, focus group discussions and document review. The results indicated that there had been a rapid increase in the number of staff attending the CPD sessions, an increased staff mix among participants, improved quality of CPD presentations, increased use of locally produced content, more relevant topics discussed and an increased interest by hospital management in CPD, manifested by commitment of staff training funds. Staff motivation, attitude and responsiveness to clients had also improved as a result of the invigorated CPD activities.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The number of children losing one or both parents to HIV/AIDS has continued to rise in the past decade, with most of them being school-aged children. This study reviews global literature on the effects of HIV/AIDS (e.g., parental HIV-related illness or death) on children's schooling. Systematic review procedures generated 23 studies for examination. Existing studies show educational disadvantages among children affected by AIDS in various educational outcomes, including school enrollment and attendance, school behavior and performance, school completion, and educational attainment. A number of individual and contextual factors potentially moderate or mediate the effect of HIV/AIDS on children's education. These factors include gender of child, pattern of parental loss (maternal vs. paternal vs. dual), living arrangement (relationship with caregivers, gender of the household head), and household poverty. Current literature indicates limitations in number and scope of existing studies and in educational outcome measurements. There is a lack of studies with longitudinal design and data collection from multiple sources (e.g., students, teachers, caregivers), and a lack of studies on the relationship between psychosocial well-being of children affected by AIDS and their educational outcomes. Future studies need to employ more rigorous methodology and incorporate both individual and contextual factors for children affected by AIDS in various regions. More efforts are needed to design and implement culturally appropriate and context-specific approaches to improve the educational outcomes of children affected by AIDS.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Lymph node metastasis in colorectal carcinoma is an important prognostic factor, yet the prognostic relevance of occult tumor cells in lymph nodes has not elucidated. This study was performed to investigate the correlation between isolated tumor cells in lymph nodes and malignancy potential in patients with Dukes B colorectal carcinoma and, thus, to determine whether presence of isolated tumor cells in lymph nodes has a prognostic significance. To evaluate the incidence of isolated tumor cells in lymph nodes in patients with Dukes B colorectal carcinoma, 1,808 lymph nodes taken from 93 patients (19.4 per case) were assessed by immunohistochemical technique using a monoclonal antihuman cytokeratin (MNF 116). Clinicopathologic parameters and prognosis were compared between patients with and without isolated tumor cells. Isolated tumor cells were identified in 54 lymph nodes from 29 patients (31.2 percent) by the immunostaining. No correlations were observed between the incidence of positive isolated tumor cells and various clinicopathologic parameters, including preoperative carcinoembryonic level, tumor site and size, histologic differentiation, pT stage, vascular invasion and lymphatic invasion, and perineural invasion. There was no difference in five-year survival estimated by Kaplan-Meier life-table method between positive and negative groups for isolated tumor cells (82.8 and 85.9 percent, respectively). Multivariate analyses showed that sex (P = 0.0236), serum carcinoembryonic level (>or= 5 ng/ml, P = 0.0002), and lymphatic vessel invasion (P = 0.0002) were significant factors in the survival time. Immunohistochemical staining with an anticytokeratin antibody is useful in identifying isolated tumor cells in lymph nodes missed in routine hematoxylin-eosin staining, but clinically it seems to be of little prognostic value in patients with Dukes B colorectal carcinoma. Thus, this immunostaining technique does not offer a significant benefit of different strategies for additional therapy or follow-up during conventional pathologic staging using hematoxylin-eosin staining.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The mechanism of interaction between chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate insecticide, and methyl mercury was assessed utilizing the amphipod, Hyalella azteca. Previous studies have demonstrated that chlorpyrifos and methyl mercury interact additively with survival as the endpoint. In addition, exposure to chlorpyrifos and methyl mercury increased the accumulation and decreased the elimination of methyl mercury. To further examine the mechanism responsible for these interactions, the in vivo and in vitro inhibition of acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity was assessed following exposure to methyl mercury and chlorpyrifos. In vivo, methyl mercury antagonized the effects of chlorpyrifos on acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Additional studies demonstrated that methyl mercury did not affect the in vitro bioactivation of chlorpyrifos or the subsequent inhibition of acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity. Chemical-chemical interactions were examined utilizing chromatographic techniques and suggested the formation of a chlorpyrifos-methyl mercury complex. The formation of this complex may result in increased accumulation of methyl mercury, apparent additive toxicity, and protection against chlorpyrifos-mediated acetylcholinesterase inhibition.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Dopamine modulates frontomedial failure processing of agentic introverts versus extraverts in incentive contexts.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The agency facet of extraversion (aE) describes individual differences in goal-directed behavior and has been linked to dopamine function in incentive contexts. Because dopamine presumably modulates the processing of negative feedback/failure, aE may relate to failure processing in incentive contexts. To test this hypothesis, N = 86 participants performed a virtual ball-catching task. An incentive context was created by displaying potential rewards and subtle manipulations of task performance, which either was (control group) or was not (incentive context group) made explicit. To probe the involvement of dopamine, participants received either placebo or the selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride (200\\xa0mg). Failure processing was assessed through negative-feedback-evoked differences in the frontal midline theta electroencephalogram power (DFMT) and in the feedback-related negativity event-related potential component (FRN). Before incentives were introduced, DFMT (but not the FRN) was related to neuroticism/anxiety. Importantly, once incentives were displayed, aE was associated with DFMT, FRN, task performance, and changes in self-reported positive affect, which further depended on incentive context group and/or substance group: In the incentive context group but not in the control group, agentic extraverts showed relatively blunted DFMT after placebo. Sulpiride significantly enhanced DFMT, whereas it reduced FRN amplitudes and performance in agentic extra- versus introverts. These findings provide strong support for current dopamine models of aE and failure processing, and also highlight the importance of task context. Moreover, the dissociations of FRN and DFMT suggest the existence of two nonredundant electrophysiological indices of feedback processing, both relating to dopamine and aE.',\n",

Population-based epidemiological survey respondents (n = 2011) completed the Brief Insomnia Questionnaire (BIQ), a validated scale generating DSM-IV, DSM-5, ICD-10, and ICSD-2 insomnia disorder. The weighted prevalence of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, waking up too early, and non-restorative sleep that occurred ≥3 days per week was 14.0%, 28.3%, 32.1%, and 39.9%, respectively. When quantitative criteria were included, the prevalence dropped the most from 39.9% to 8.4% for non-restorative sleep, and the least from 14.0% to 12.9% for difficulty falling asleep. The weighted prevalence of DSM-IV, ICD-10, ICSD-2, and any of the three insomnia disorders was 22.1%, 4.7%, 15.1%, and 22.1%, respectively; for DSM-5 insomnia disorder, it was 10.8%. Compared with 22.1%, 3.9%, and 14.7% for DSM-IV, ICD-10, and ICSD-2 in the AIS, cross-cultural difference in the prevalence of insomnia disorder is less than what is expected. The prevalence is reduced by half from DSM-IV to DSM-5. ICD-10 insomnia disorder has the lowest prevalence, perhaps because excessive concern and preoccupation, one of its diagnostic criteria, is not always present in people with insomnia.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'This study examined the effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in primary care for patients with recurrent depression (major depressive disorder: MDD). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), MDD is now the leading cause of disease burden in middle- and high-income countries. Patients (N\\xa0=\\xa045) with three or more previous depressive episodes were recruited to participate in MBCT as a preventative intervention. Using a benchmarking approach, outcome data was compared with data from a recent efficacy study. The methodology is a rigorous approach to assessing effectiveness when evidence-based UK protocols are transferred into the existing Scandinavian service delivery. Additionally, a person-centred methodological approach was used to assess clinical significance on the Reliable Change Index (RCI). The analysis revealed comparable or larger effects from pre-test to post-test in reduced psychiatric symptoms, increased quality of life and level of mindfulness, and the effects were maintained over 14 months. Analysis of the relapse rate in the current study (16%) compared to the TAU in the efficacy study (68%) yielded an h value of 0.78, a moderate effect size. Only 13% dropped out of the treatment. According to the RCI findings, 65% to 67% of participants in the clinical group improved, no individual worsened, and women showed a significantly greater improvement of depression and anxiety than men. Therapeutic alliance and motivation had no impact on the outcome. The overall result suggests that MBCT can be implemented successfully in Scandinavian primary health care as a preventive intervention for patients with recurrent depression.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Interdisciplinary exploration is vital to education in the 21st century. This manuscript outlines an innovative laboratory-based teaching method that combines elements of biochemistry/molecular biology, kinesiology/health science, computer science, and manufacturing engineering to give students the ability to better conceptualize complex biological systems. Here, we utilize technology available at most universities to print three-dimensional (3D) scale models of actual human muscle cells (myofibers) out of bioplastic materials. The same methodological approach could be applied to nearly any cell type or molecular structure. This advancement is significant because historically, two-dimensional (2D) myocellular images have proven insufficient for detailed analysis of organelle organization and morphology. 3D imaging fills this void by providing accurate and quantifiable myofiber structural data. Manipulating tangible 3D models combats 2D limitation and gives students new perspectives and alternative learning experiences that may assist their understanding. This approach also exposes learners to 1) human muscle cell extraction and isolation, 2) targeted fluorescence labeling, 3) confocal microscopy, 4) image processing (via open-source software), and 5) 3D printing bioplastic scale-models (×500 larger than the actual cells). Creating these physical models may further student's interest in the invisible world of molecular and cellular biology. Furthermore, this interdisciplinary laboratory project gives instructors of all biological disciplines a new teaching tool to foster integrative thinking.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The aim of this study was to assess the psychopathological and behavioural problems in patients affected by any tic disorder and their relationship with the severity of tic symptomatology. A cross-sectional assessment was made of 125 children and adolescents affected by any tic disorder, all at their first neuropsychiatric evaluation and all drug naïve. Tic disorder diagnoses were established by using The Tourette Syndrome Classification Study Group criteria; the procedures included the administration of Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), Children Yale-Brown-Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) and Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). The patients showed a mild to moderate tic disorder (mean YGTSS score = 27). Of the patients, 19% had Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but another 46% showed Obsessive-Compulsive (OC) symptoms. CBCL T total was pathologic in 17% of the children, with higher percentages in the Internalization and Attention Problems subscales. Statistical analysis pointed out a significant relationship between YGTSS and CY-BOCS scores as well as a significant relationship between the duration of tic symptomatology and several CBCL subscales (Internalization, Depressed/Anxious, Thought and Attention Problems). Our data can be summarized in three main points: a large number of patients have milder tics without any psychopathological comorbidity; OC symptoms are frequently associated with tics, mainly in children with more severe symptomatology; psychopathological problems, in particular internalizing difficulties, are present in children with long standing tic disorders.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) testing is performed to determine if an atypical steroid profile is due to administration of an endogenous steroid. Androsterone (Andro) and etiocholanolone (Etio), and/or the androstanediols (5α- and 5β-androstane-3α,17β-diol) are typically analyzed by IRMS to determine the (13) C/(12) C ratio. The ratios of these target compounds are compared to the (13) C/(12) C ratio of an endogenous reference compound (ERC) such as 5β-pregnane-3α,20α-diol (Pdiol). Concentrations of Andro and Etio are high so (13) C/(12) C ratios can easily be measured in most urine samples. Despite the potentially improved sensitivity of the androstanediols for detecting the use of some testosterone formulations, additional processing steps are often required that increase labour costs and turnaround times. Since this can be problematic when performing large numbers of IRMS measurements, we established thresholds for Andro and Etio that can be used to determine the need for additional androstanediol testing. Using these criteria, 105 out of 2639 urine samples exceeded the Andro and/or Etio thresholds, with 52 of these samples being positive based on Andro and Etio IRMS testing alone. The remaining 53 urine samples had androstanediol IRMS testing performed and 3 samples were positive based on the androstanediol results. A similar strategy was used to establish a threshold for Pdiol to identify athletes with relatively (13) C-depleted values so that an alternative ERC can be used to confirm or establish a true endogenous reference value. Adoption of a similar strategy by other laboratories can significantly reduce IRMS sample processing and analysis times, thereby increasing testing capacity.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Cancer Care Ontario's Screening Activity Report (SAR) is an online audit and feedback tool designed to help primary care physicians in Ontario, Canada, identify patients who are overdue for cancer screening or have abnormal results requiring follow-up. Use of the SAR is associated with increased screening rates. To encourage SAR use, Cancer Care Ontario sends monthly emails to registered primary care physicians announcing that updated data are available. However, analytics reveal that 50% of email recipients do not open the email and less than 7% click the embedded link to log in to their report. The goal of the study is to determine whether rewritten emails result in increased log-ins. This manuscript describes how different user- and theory-informed messages intended to improve the impact of the monthly emails will be experimentally tested and how a process evaluation will explore why and how any effects observed were (or were not) achieved. A user-centered approach was used to rewrite the content of the monthly email, including messages operationalizing 3 behavior change techniques: anticipated regret, material incentive (behavior), and problem solving. A pragmatic, 2x2x2 factorial experiment within a multiphase optimization strategy will test the redesigned emails with an embedded qualitative process evaluation to understand how and why the emails may or may not have worked. Trial outcomes will be ascertained using routinely collected administrative data. Physicians will be recruited for semistructured interviews using convenience and snowball sampling. As of April 2017, 5576 primary care physicians across the province of Ontario, Canada, had voluntarily registered for the SAR, and in so doing, signed up to receive the monthly email updates. From May to August 2017 participants received the redesigned monthly emails with content specific to their allocated experimental condition prompting use of the SAR. We have not yet begun analyses. This study will inform how to communicate effectively with primary care providers by email and identify which behavior change techniques tested are most effective at encouraging engagement with an audit and feedback report.

       "  'Abstract': 'Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare hereditary cancer syndrome that reduces life expectancy. We aimed to construct a more valuable genotype-phenotype correlation based on alterations in VHL protein (pVHL). VHL patients (n\\u2009=\\u2009339) were recruited and grouped based on mutation types: HIF-α binding site missense (HM) mutations, non-HIF-α binding site missense (nHM) mutations, and truncating (TR) mutations. Age-related risks of VHL-associated tumors and patient survival were compared. Missense mutations conferred an increased risk of pheochromocytoma (HR\\u2009=\\u20091.854, p\\u2009=\\u20090.047) compared with truncating mutations. The risk of pheochromocytoma was lower in the HM group than in the nHM group (HR\\u2009=\\u20090.298, p\\u2009=\\u20090.003) but was similar between HM and TR groups (HR\\u2009=\\u20090.901, p\\u2009=\\u20090.810). Patients in the nHM group had a higher risk of pheochromocytoma (HR\\u2009=\\u20093.447, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and lower risks of central nervous system hemangioblastoma (CHB) (HR\\u2009=\\u20090.700, p\\u2009=\\u20090.045), renal cell carcinoma (HR\\u2009=\\u20090.610, p\\u2009=\\u20090.024), and pancreatic tumor (HR\\u2009=\\u20090.382, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) than those in the combined HM and TR (HMTR) group.

       "  'Title': 'The association between the vascular endothelial growth factor-to-cancer antigen 125 ratio in peritoneal dialysis effluent and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'We examined peritoneal growth factors, mesothelial mass, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in response to peritoneal exposure to peritoneal dialysate with standard and low concentrations of glucose degradation products (GDPs). We randomized 56 incident continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients to receive either low-GDP (30 patients) or high-GDP (standard) peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution (26 patients). The effects of the PD solutions on EMT and peritoneal growth factors in overnight dialysate effluent were compared at 1, 6, and 12 months. Assessment of EMT was performed after human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) were cultured from overnight effluent. The low-GDP solution group showed significantly higher dialysate levels of cancer antigen 125 (CA125), fibronectin, transforming growth factor beta(TGFbeta)-induced gene product (betaig-h3), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), but the rate of EMT was significantly lower in the low-GDP solution group during the initial 12 months of CAPD treatment. After adjusting peritoneal growth factors for dialysate CA125 concentration, the low-GDP solution group showed significantly lower ratios of fibronectin/CA125, betaig-h3/CA125, IL-6/CA125, TGFbeta/CA125, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/CA125 than did patients in the high-GDP (standard) solution group. Factors associated with higher EMT were the type of solution (high in GDPs), the mass of HPMCs (low CA125), and higher VEGF/CA125. Adjustment of dialysate VEGF for effluent CA125 revealed a significant association with EMT. It suggests that fibroblastoid transition from HPMCs could be affected by the intraperitoneal VEGF per unit mass of HPMCs.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Malignant melanoma (MM) is a cancer with rapidly growing incidence in all age groups and-if not detected early-mostly poor prognosis. After wide excision of the primary tumour, patients without metastases are subjected to follow-up examinations. No further standard medical treatment is currently available for such patients. This results in psychosocial stress, and psychological adjustment and social support are needed-especially in patients with poor prognosis and visible scars. This article reviews recent evidence of the psychosocial correlates in melanoma disease in the context of past research. Factors discussed include psychosocial distress, coping with cancer, support from the social network, and the need for professional psychosocial intervention and its effectiveness. Previous studies which have investigated the correlation between psychosocial factors and the course of the disease are also reviewed.

       "  'Abstract': 'Despite the availability of several therapeutic options, a safer and more effective modality is urgently needed for treatment of bladder cancer. Costunolide, a member of sesquiterpene lactone family, possesses potent anticancer properties. In this study, for the first time we investigated the effects of costunolide on the cell viability and apoptosis in human bladder cancer T24 cells. Treatment of T24 cells with costunolide resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell viability and induction of apoptosis which was associated with the generation of ROS and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). These effects were significantly blocked when the cells were pretreated with N-acetyl- cysteine (NAC), a specific ROS inhibitor. Exposure of T24 cells to costunolide was also associated with increased expression of Bax, down-regulation of Bcl-2, survivin and significant activation of caspase-3, and its downstream target PARP. These findings provide the rationale for further in vivo and clinical investigation of costunolide against human bladder cancer.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Enhancing antitumor activities of the human immune system is a clinically proven approach with the advent of monoclonal antibodies recognizing programmed cell death protein-1 (PD1) receptors on immune cell surfaces. Historically, using flow cytometry as a means to assess next-generation agent activities was underused, largely due to limits on cell number and assay sensitivity. Here, we leveraged an IntelliCyt high-throughput flow cytometry platform to monitor human dendritic cell maturation and lymphocyte proliferation in mixed lymphocyte reactions. Specifically, we established flow cytometry-based immunophenotyping and screening methodologies capable of measuring T-cell activation as a result of cell-associated antigens presented on dendritic cell surfaces, as indicated by cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and surface marker expression. Together, the overall novelty of this 384-well platform is its capability to measure multiple functional readouts in one well and consistently evaluate large numbers of compounds in a single study, as well as its ability to show increased assay sensitivity requiring considerably fewer primary cells and less reagents compared to more traditional 96-well flow cytometry methods.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Weakening of the interface between adjacent catalytic chains promotes domain closure in Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Aspartate transcarbamoylase from Escherichia coli is a dodecameric enzyme consisting of two trimeric catalytic subunits and three dimeric regulatory subunits. Asp-100, from one catalytic chain, is involved in stabilizing the C1-C2 interface by means of its interaction with Arg-65 from an adjacent catalytic chain. Replacement of Asp-100 by Ala has been shown previously to result in increases in the maximal specific activity, homotropic cooperativity, and the affinity for aspartate (Baker DP, Kantrowitz ER, 1993, Biochemistry 32:10150-10158). In order to determine whether these properties were due to promotion of domain closure induced by the weakening of the C1-C2 interface, we constructed a double mutant version of aspartate transcarbamoylase in which the Asp-100-->Ala mutation was introduced into the Glu-50-->Ala holoenzyme, a mutant in which domain closure is impaired. The Glu-50/Asp-100-->Ala enzyme is fourfold more active than the Glu-50-->Ala enzyme, and exhibits significant restoration of homotropic cooperativity with respect to aspartate. In addition, the Asp-100-->Ala mutation restores the ability of the Glu-50-->Ala enzyme to be activated by succinate and increases the affinity of the enzyme for the bisubstrate analogue N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA). At subsaturating concentrations of aspartate, the Glu-50/Asp-100-->Ala enzyme is activated more by ATP than the Glu-50-->Ala enzyme and is also inhibited more by CTP than either the wild-type or the Glu-50-->Ala enzyme. As opposed to the wild-type enzyme, the Glu-50/Asp-100-->Ala enzyme is activated by ATP and inhibited by CTP at saturating concentrations of aspartate. Structural analysis of the Glu-50/Asp-100-->Ala enzyme by solution X-ray scattering indicates that the double mutant exists in the same T quaternary structure as the wild-type enzyme in the absence of ligands and in the same R quaternary structure in the presence of saturating PALA. However, saturating concentrations of carbamoyl phosphate and succinate only convert a fraction of the Glu-50/Asp-100-->Ala enzyme population to the R quaternary structure, a behavior intermediate between that observed for the Glu-50-->Ala and wild-type enzymes. Solution X-ray scattering was also used to investigate the structural consequences of nucleotide binding to the Glu-50/Asp-100-->Ala enzyme.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The EGFR and PKB pathways are frequently activated in cancer, so are prime targets for cancer therapy. To this end, new inhibitors are being tested. EGFR inhibitors as single therapy have little benefit, although therapies that evoke an antitumor immune response are more effective. Resistance mutations within the EGFR are common, as is activation of the antiapoptotic PKB pathway via alternative tyrosine kinase receptors, especially other EGFR family members or IGF1R. To combat resistance, multitargeted EGFR inhibitors and combined inhibition of the EGFR and PKB are being investigated. Inhibition of the EGFR and PKB pathways also sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapy. Thus, EGFR and PI3K/PKB inhibitors will be most effective when used in rational combinations of targeted inhibitors and traditional chemotherapy.',\n",

This case-control study was performed on 90 children -6 months to 16 years old, in Zabol, Amir- al- Momenin Hospital. Patients were divided in two groups and were matched in age and sex. All Children were examined and those eligible children who had not known heart disease, iron deficiency anemia, kidney disease, diabetes, fever and systemic diseases were enrolled after taking the informed consent of their parents. After collecting the samples, leptin and ferritin levels of the serum were measured in two groups by ELISA method. Then, the data was analyzed by the related statistical tests and SPSS 20 software. The mean of the serum levels of leptin and ferritin showed a significant difference in the case and control groups (P-value<0.05). An inverse statistical correlation was found for the serum levels of leptin and ferritin among the studied groups (P-value<0.05). Levels of leptin in the case group showed a significant gender difference (P-value<0.05), while based on BMI and age, no significant difference was observed for the serum levels of leptin in the case group.

       "  'Abstract': 'The purpose of this paper is to determine the necessity of a dedicated facial bone/orbital computed tomography (CT) scan for fracture surveillance in patients who have suffered blunt head trauma and whose routine nonenhanced head CT scan is negative. It is based on a retrospective review of 115 patients presenting to the Emergency Department at a level I trauma center after blunt head trauma. Included patients underwent both a nonenhanced head CT scan and a dedicated facial bone or orbit CT. Standard nonenhanced head CT protocol was followed for each patient as per department protocol. A positive head CT scan is defined to include either an air-fluid level within the paranasal sinuses or fracture of the maxillary, orbital, or zygomatic osseous structures. A negative scan demonstrates none of these findings. Intracranial/parenchymal pathology was not evaluated in this study. Sixty-five of the 115 patients had a negative head CT scan as defined above. Of these 65 patients, none subsequently had a positive facial bone or orbit CT scan. The sensitivity and negative predictive values of a negative routine nonenhanced head CT scan for fracture surveillance are both 100%. In the setting of blunt trauma, a negative nonenhanced head CT scan precludes the need for a dedicated facial bone or orbital CT scan in the evaluation for orbital, maxillary, or zygomatic fractures. This saves the patient unnecessary radiation exposure, health care costs, and time spent in the emergency radiology department.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Gene therapy and DNA vaccination applications have increased the demand for highly purified plasmid DNA (pDNA) in the last years. One of the main problems related to the scale-up of pDNA purification is the degradation of the supercoiled (sc) isoforms during cell culture and multi-stage purification. In this work, a systematic study of the stability of two model plasmids (3,697 and 6,050 bp) during a mid-scale production process, which includes fermentation, alkaline lysis, isopropanol and ammonium sulphate precipitation and hydrophobic interaction chromatography, was performed. Results indicate that by extending cell culture (up to 26 h) and cell lysis (up to 2 h) it is possible to significantly reduce the amounts of RNA, without significantly compromising the yields of the sc pDNA isoform, a feature that could be conveniently exploited for downstream processing purposes. The stability of pDNA upon storage of E. coli pellets at different temperatures indicates that, differently from RNA, pDNA is remarkably stable when stored in cell pellets (>3 weeks at 4 degrees C, >12 weeks at -20 degrees C) prior to processing. With alkaline lysates, however, storage at -20 degrees C is mandatory to avoid sc pDNA degradation within the first 8 weeks. Furthermore, the subsequent purification steps could be carried out at room temperature without significant pDNA degradation. Since the unit operations and process conditions studied in this work are similar to those generally used for plasmid DNA production, the results presented here may contribute to improve the current knowledge on plasmid stability and process optimization.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The Yarrowia lipolytica MFE2 gene encodes peroxisomal beta-oxidation multifunctional enzyme type 2 (MFE2). MFE2 is peroxisomal in a wild-type strain but is cytosolic in a strain lacking the peroxisomal targeting signal-1 (PTS1) receptor. MFE2 has a PTS1, Ala-Lys-Leu, that is essential for targeting to peroxisomes. MFE2 lacking a PTS1 can apparently oligomerize with full-length MFE2 to enable targetting to peroxisomes. Peroxisomes of an oleic acid-induced MFE2 deletion strain, mfe2-KO, are larger and more abundant than those of the wild-type strain. Under growth conditions not requiring peroxisomes, peroxisomes of mfe2-KO are larger but less abundant than those of the wild-type strain, suggesting a role for MFE2 in the regulation of peroxisome size and number. A nonfunctional version of MFE2 did not restore normal peroxisome morphology to mfe2-KO cells, indicating that their phenotype is not due to the absence of MFE2. mfe2-KO cells contain higher amounts of beta-oxidation enzymes than do wild-type cells. We also show that increasing the level of the beta-oxidation enzyme thiolase results in enlarged peroxisomes. Our results implicate peroxisomal beta-oxidation in the control of peroxisome size and number in yeast.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Vacuolar protein sorting protein 29 (Vps29p), which is involved in retrograde trafficking from prevacuolar endosomes to the trans-Golgi network, performs its biological functions by participating in the formation of a \"retromer complex.\" In human cells, this complex comprises four conserved proteins: hVps35p, hVps29p, hVps26p, and sorting nexin 1 protein (SNX1). Here, we report the crystal structure of hVps29p at 2.1 Angstroms resolution, the first three-dimensional structure of the retromer subunits. This novel structure adopts a four-layered alpha-beta-beta-alpha sandwich fold. hVps29p contains a metal-binding site that is very similar to the active sites of some proteins of the phosphodiesterase/nuclease protein family, indicating that hVps29p may carry out chemically similar functions. Structure and sequence conservation analysis suggests that hVps29p contains two protein-protein interaction sites. One site, which potentially serves as the interface between hVps29p and hVps35p, comprises 5 conserved hydrophobic and 8 hydrophilic residues. The other site is relatively more hydrophilic and may serve as a binding interface with hVps26p, SNX1, or other target proteins.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that diabetes mellitus is a serious health burden for both governments and healthcare providers. This study was hypothesized to evaluate the antihyperglycemic potential of eugenol by determine the activities of key enzymes of glucose metabolism in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced into male albino Wistar rats by intraperitoneal administration of STZ (40 mg/kg body weight (b.w.)). Eugenol was administered to diabetic rats intragastrically at 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg b.w. for 30 days. The dose 10 mg/kg b.w. significantly reduced the levels of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and increased plasma insulin level. The altered activities of the key enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism such as hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and liver marker enzymes (AST, ALT, and ALP), creatine kinase and blood urea nitrogen in serum and blood of diabetic rats were significantly reverted to near normal levels by the administration of eugenol. Further, eugenol administration to diabetic rats improved body weight and hepatic glycogen content demonstrated the antihyperglycemic potential of eugenol in diabetic rats. The present findings suggest that eugenol can potentially ameliorate key enzymes of glucose metabolism in experimental diabetes, and it is sensible to broaden the scale of use of eugenol in a trial to alleviate the adverse effects of diabetes.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"This study focuses on the research question of how health providers approach treatment of culturally diverse infertile clients. Findings from in-depth interviews of 28 health providers in a major city in Southern California revealed three types of providers: (1) culturally unaware, (2) culturally nontolerant, and 3) culturally sensitive. Culturally unaware providers failed to recognize different cultural needs and treated all clients in the same way, an approach that eventually led to noncompliance. Culturally nontolerant providers recognized diverse needs, but they were unwilling to tolerate cultural conflicts in treatment or to change treatment protocols. This often resulted in providers terminating treatment or making referrals to a more culturally tolerant provider. Culturally sensitive providers acquired information on cultural beliefs, worked within clients' limitations, and adapted tests and treatment protocols to meet clients' needs. These findings may offer insights into care and treatment approaches used by health providers in a highly technological, specialist-level treatment of culturally diverse clients in an urban setting.\",\n",

However, the mean value of TP in males (8.0±0.5g/dl for the Japanese and 8.0±0.4g/dl for the Dutch) was significantly higher than this in females (7.7±0.3g/dl for the Japanese and 7.5±0.5g/dl for the Dutch) in the each group (p<0.01) and the mean value of Alb of male Dutch students (4.9±0.2g/dl) was higher than that in females (4.5±0.3g/dl, p<0.01). No significant differences were found between the two groups in serum lipid and mineral levels. The serum phospholipid (PL) level in female Dutch students (217±37mg/dl) was significantly higher than that in males (188±25mg/dl, p<0.01), while the serum triglyceride (TG) level in female Japanese students (60±25mg/dl) was significantly lower than that in males (74±33mg/dl, p<0.05), which agreed with the frequency distribution patterns of these lipids. Comparing the two student groups of both countries, there were significant positive correlations between TP and Alb (p<0.001 for both groups), TP and Glb (p<0.001 for both groups) and Alb and A/G ratio (p<0.001 for the Japanese and p<0.01 for the Dutch) in each group.

       "  'Abstract': 'In previous work we have developed a diary instrument-the Social Rhythm Metric (SRM), which allows the assessment of lifestyle regularity-and a questionnaire instrument--the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which allows the assessment of subjective sleep quality. The aim of the present study was to explore the relationship between lifestyle regularity and subjective sleep quality. Lifestyle regularity was assessed by both standard (SRM-17) and shortened (SRM-5) metrics; subjective sleep quality was assessed by the PSQI. We hypothesized that high lifestyle regularity would be conducive to better sleep. Both instruments were given to a sample of 100 healthy subjects who were studied as part of a variety of different experiments spanning a 9-yr time frame. Ages ranged from 19 to 49 yr (mean age: 31.2 yr, s.d.: 7.8 yr); there were 48 women and 52 men. SRM scores were derived from a two-week diary. The hypothesis was confirmed. There was a significant (rho = -0.4, p < 0.001) correlation between SRM (both metrics) and PSQI, indicating that subjects with higher levels of lifestyle regularity reported fewer sleep problems. This relationship was also supported by a categorical analysis, where the proportion of \"poor sleepers\" was doubled in the \"irregular types\" group as compared with the \"non-irregular types\" group. Thus, there appears to be an association between lifestyle regularity and good sleep, though the direction of causality remains to be tested.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"1. Complete 24 h energy and nitrogen balances were measured for eight subjects both while consuming a basal diet supplemented with 49 g saccharose/d (diet S) and while consuming the same basal diet but supplemented with 50 g lactitol monohydrate/d (diet L). 2. The subjects ate the two diets for 8 d. Faeces and urine were collected for the final 4 d. Exchange of respiratory gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane) was measured during the final 72 h while the subjects stayed in an open-circuit respiration chamber, 11 m3, and simulated office work. Before eating diet L, subjects ate 50 g lactitol daily for 10 d. 3. On diets L and S, faecal moisture content averaged 0.787 and 0.753 g/g respectively, the difference being significant (P less than 0.05). On diet L, energy and nitrogen digestibilities and energy metabolizability averaged 0.922, 0.836 and 0.881 respectively, and on diet S 0.935, 0.869 and 0.896 respectively; the differences were also significant (P less than 0.05). Urinary energy losses and N balances were not significantly different for the two diets. 4. In all subjects only traces of methane were produced but hydrogen production differed significantly (P less than 0.05) for diets L and S, being 2.3 and 0.4 litres (normal temperature and pressure)/d respectively. 5. Intakes of metabolizable energy (ME) were corrected, within subjects, to energy equilibrium and equal metabolic body-weight. The corrected ME intakes did not show differences between diets. However, when on diet L the subjects were probably less active than when on diet S because differences within subjects of ankle actometer counts between diets showed a high correlation with the corresponding differences in corrected ME intakes (r 0.92). Further correction of ME intake toward equal actometer activity showed a significant (P less than 0.05) difference between diets: for maintaining energy equilibrium 5.6 (SE 0.8; P less than 0.05)% more ME from diet L was needed than from diet S. The reliability of this 5.6% difference depends on whether or not one ankle actometer gives an accurate picture of the subject's physical activity. 6. The energy contribution to the body is clearly smaller from lactitol than from saccharose, certainly due to the effect of lactitol on digestion, and probably also due to the effect on the utilization of ME.\",\n",

We recently reported a series of tumors in patients younger than 20 years at diagnosis and performed exhaustive genetic screening for molecular alterations. Few events typical of bladder urothelial cell carcinoma were detected. Since many carcinogenic events occur at the epigenetic rather than the genetic level, we analyzed the same tumors for alterations in DNA hypermethylation. We compared our findings with those in tumors in older patients with similar pathological profiles. We analyzed 76 bladder urothelial cell carcinomas from 3 groups stratified by age at diagnosis, including less than 19, 20 to 45 and greater than 46 years (median 78), and matched for low grade and nonmuscle invasive stage. We used quantified methyl specific polymerase chain reaction to investigate promoter methylation for 8 tumor suppressor genes implicated in urothelial carcinogenesis. Tumors in the youngest age group had the lowest incidence of global hypermethylation compared to the other tumors with a methyl index of 37.5% vs 62.5% and 50%, respectively (ANOVA p = 0.009). When individual loci were analyzed, younger patients had a significantly lower rate and concentration of methylation at APC, Bcl2, MGMT and E-cadherin promoters than in the older groups (p <0.05). Few differences were present between the 2 older cohorts but the APC and MGMT methylation concentration increased with age. Urothelial tumors in patients younger than 19 years have a low rate of epigenetic alteration. Tumors in patients older than 20 years have epigenetic profiles similar to those of tumors in patients within the typical bladder urothelial cell carcinoma age range.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"1. We examined the effects of P2X purinoceptor agonists and P2 purinoceptor antagonists on mesenteric afferent nerves supplying the jejunum in the pentobarbitone sodium-anaesthetised rat. 2. ATP (0. 01-10 mg kg-1, i.a.) and alpha,beta-methylene-ATP (1-30 microg kg-1, i.a.) each induced dose-dependent increases in afferent nerve discharge and intrajejunal pressure. The effect on afferent nerves comprised an early (< 2 s after administration) intense burst of activity followed by a later increase (> 2 s after administration), less pronounced in comparison, which coincided with elevated intrajejunal pressure. 3. Pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2', 4'-disulphonic acid (20 mg kg-1, i.v.) and suramin (80 mg kg-1, i.v. ) each antagonised both the early and later increases in afferent nerve discharge elicited by alpha,beta-methylene-ATP (30 microg kg-1, i.a.). 4. Co-administration of omega-conotoxin MVIIA and omega-conotoxin SVIB (each at 25 microg kg-1, i.v.), or treatment with the selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist alosetron (30 microg kg-1, i.v.), did not affect the rapid burst of afferent nerve activity elicited by alpha,beta-methylene-ATP (30 microg kg-1, i.a.). However, toxin treatment did attenuate the elevations in intrajejunal pressure and the corresponding later phases of evoked afferent discharge, while alosetron inhibited basal afferent nerve activity. 5. In summary, ATP and alpha,beta-methylene-ATP each evoke excitation of mesenteric afferent nerves in the anaesthetised rat. We propose that the early increase in mesenteric afferent nerve activity represents a direct effect on the nerve ending, mediated by P2X receptors, whereas the later increase reflects activation of mechanosensitive fibres secondary to elevated intrajejunal pressure.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'This comprehensive study of neosporosis in dairy cattle in Galicia (NW Spain) included: (1) a comparative study of three serological techniques for detection of Neospora caninum antibodies (direct agglutination, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence); (2) a cross-sectional serological survey in which 276 herds and 5,196 animals were tested; (3) a study of N. caninum antibody dynamics; (4) the isolation of viable tachyzoites of N. caninum. Data were analysed to determine the risk factors associated with the infection. A total of 219 herds (79.3%) and 816 heads of cattle (15.7%) were found to be seropositive. Seropositivity was higher on farms with dogs than on farms without dogs, and there was a negative correlation between the size of the herds and seroprevalence. Co-infection with Toxoplasma gondii increased the risk of seropositivity. Cows infected with N. caninum were 5.3 times more likely to abort than non-infected cows. The dynamics study showed an increase in anti-N. caninum antibody titres during the third trimester of pregnancy. Viable tachyzoites were isolated from brain samples. These results indicate that the economic impact of N. caninum is high in Galicia, and therefore, the inclusion of control measures for neosporosis in the official control health programmes is strongly recommended.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"N-Acetylcysteine is useful in the short-term treatment of severe Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ulcers (DU) in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), but its long-term effects are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to report long-term outcome (median follow-up 3 years) in a prospective study of a cohort of 50 consecutive patients with SSc who received N-acetylcysteine (NAC) infusional therapy every 2 weeks. We observed a reduction of DU/patient/year (4.5 +/- 3.1 vs 0.81 +/- 0.79) and DU ulcer visual analog scale (VAS; 6.88 +/- 2.62 vs 3.20 +/- 1.80), a decrease of the Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) number attacks (7.18 +/- 3.87 vs 3 +/- 1.92), and RP VAS (6.24 +/- 1.92 vs 3.62 +/- 1.48). In this study, we did not observe serious adverse events in patients. Minor side effects were flushing (two patients) and headache (one patient). NAC infusion was generally well tolerated, and nobody had to discontinue the treatment. In conclusion, long-term therapy with NAC, in patients with SSc, has a durable effectiveness on ischemic ulcers and Raynaud's phenomenon.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'HIV gp120 is an aberrant chemoattractant for blood resting CD4 T cells.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Binding of HIV gp120 to the chemokine coreceptor CXCR4 mediates signal transduction that promotes actin dynamics critical for the establishment of viral latency in resting CD4 T cells. To some extent, this gp120-mediated signal transduction resembles the chemotactic response mediated by chemokines such as the stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha (SDF-1). It has been suggested that gp120 functions as a bona fide chemokine to attract or repel blood CD4 T cells. To determine whether gp120 is a viral chemoattractant, we compared the chemotactic properties of gp120 with those of SDF- 1, and confirmed previous observations that gp120 possesses some chemotactic ability at certain dosages. However, when we examined gp120 in a range of dosages, we found that in general, gp120 only attracts or repels blood resting CD4 T cells at a low level, and there is no clear pattern of dosage-dependency as normally seen in a typical chemokine. These irregularities of gp120 were observed in multiple donors. Nevertheless, gp120 aberrantly interferes with SDF-1-mediated T cell chemotaxis and cell migration. These results suggest that gp120 does not act like a typical chemoattractant, although it triggers actin dynamics to facilitate HIV infection.',\n",
