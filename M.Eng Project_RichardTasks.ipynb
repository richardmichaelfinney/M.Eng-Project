       "  'Abstract': \"To explore the clinical significance of typical reflux symptoms in the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Consecutive patients older than 16 years, who initially visited department of gastroenterology at clinic of Peking University Third Hospital from May 9, 2012 to Dec 31, 2012, were required to complete a self-reported GERD questionnaire. Upper endoscopy was performed in some selected patients. A total of 18 987 patients were enrolled with a response rate of 91.5%. The prevalence of symptom-defined GERD was 13.6% (2 579/18 987). A total of 4 357 (22.9%) patients underwent the upper endoscopy, and the diagnostic rates of reflux esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, peptic ulcer disease, and upper gastrointestinal malignancy were 13.1% (572/4 357), 1.8% (78/4 357), 10.5% (456/4 357), and 1.7% (75/4 357), respectively. The incidence of reflux esophagitis was 22.7% (216/951) in patients with reflux symptoms and 10.5% (356/3 406) (P < 0.001) in patients without reflux symptoms, 2.7% (26/951) and 1.5% (52/3 406), respectively (P = 0.013) for Barrett's esophagus; 6.8% (65/951) and 11.5% (391/3 406), respectively (P < 0.001) for peptic ulcer disease; 1.7% (16/951) and 1.7% (59/3 406), respectively (P = 0.917) for upper gastrointestinal malignancy. GERD is one of the major diseases at gastroenterology clinic. Typical reflux symptoms suggest a diagnosis of GERD. But some patients with peptic ulcer disease or upper gastrointestinal malignancy can also present typical reflux symptoms. Upper endoscopy is valuable to avoid the misdiagnosis of other disorders.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We investigate the ground state and excitations of finite-size Heisenberg loops doped with one hole as the simplest example to illustrate the nature of strong correlations in a doped Mott insulator. We show that the doped hole form a peculiar long-range entanglement with the surrounding spins as revealed by inspecting the mutual correlations between the charge and spin using exact diagonalization (ED). In particular, the one-hole ground state acquires a series of non-trivial total momenta depending on the ratio J/t (J and t denote the superexchange coupling and hopping integral, respectively), which gives rise to distinct quantum phases separated by critical points (CPs). Interestingly the novel total momentum and correlations completely disappear once a singular sign structure is turned off in the t-J model, indicating the latter is the true original source for strong correlation via many-body quantum interference. We emphasize that the novelties discovered here are not restricted to the one-dimensional loop. We introduce a new charge-spin mutual entanglement that can well characterize these exotic properties, which can be then easily generalized to more realistic situations like two dimensions.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disorder that is characterized by aberrant tissue remodeling and the formation of fibroblastic foci that are composed of fibrogenic myofibroblasts. TGF-β1 is one of the factors that are responsible for fibrosis as it promotes fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) and is associated with up-regulation of α-smooth muscle actin. Therefore, inhibition of FMD may represent an effective strategy for the treatment of IPF. Here, we describe the treatment of human lung fibroblasts (WI-38 and HFL-1 cells) with cyclosporine A (CsA), which reduces TGF-β1-induced FMD <i>via</i> degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). In addition, in primary myofibroblast-like cells that were obtained from a patient with pulmonary fibrosis, treatment with CsA and an HIF-1α inhibitor (HIFi) decreased the expression levels of α-smooth muscle actin and fibronectin, which indicated that CsA and HIFi promote dedifferentiation of myofibroblasts. In mice intratracheally administered CsA or HIFi at an early fibrotic stage [7, 8, and 9 d postinstillation (dpi) of bleomycin], marked alleviation of lung fibrosis was observed at 14 dpi. These results suggest that CsA exhibits antifibrotic effects by degrading HIF-1α and that the CsA-HIF-1α axis provides new insights into therapeutic options for the treatment of IPF.-Yamazaki, R., Kasuya, Y., Fujita, T., Umezawa, H., Yanagihara, M., Nakamura, H., Yoshino, I., Tatsumi, K., Murayama, T.

       "  'Abstract': 'O-linked β-N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is an essential and ubiquitous post-translational modification present in nucleic and cytoplasmic proteins of multicellular eukaryotes. The metabolic chemical probes such as GlcNAc or GalNAc analogues bearing ketone or azide handles, in conjunction with bioorthogonal reactions, provide a powerful approach for detecting and identifying this modification. However, these chemical probes either enter multiple glycosylation pathways or have low labeling efficiency. Therefore, selective and potent probes are needed to assess this modification. We report here the development of a novel probe, 1,3,6-tri-O-acetyl-2-azidoacetamido-2,4-dideoxy-d-glucopyranose (Ac<sub>3</sub>4dGlcNAz), that can be processed by the GalNAc salvage pathway and transferred by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) to O-GlcNAc proteins. Due to the absence of a hydroxyl group at C4, this probe is less incorporated into α/β 4-GlcNAc or GalNAc containing glycoconjugates. Furthermore, the O-4dGlcNAz modification was resistant to the hydrolysis of O-GlcNAcase (OGA), which greatly enhanced the efficiency of incorporation for O-GlcNAcylation. Combined with a click reaction, Ac<sub>3</sub>4dGlcNAz allowed the selective visualization of O-GlcNAc in cells and accurate identification of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins with LC-MS/MS. This probe represents a more potent and selective tool in tracking, capturing, and identifying O-GlcNAc-modified proteins in cells and cell lysates.',\n",

Their heterogeneous character and clinical aggressiveness remain a challenge for clinical, pathological diagnosis and for therapy selection. Several types have been described, although small cell carcinoma represents the major subgroup of neuroendocrine tumors as compared to large cell carcinoma and carcinoid subtypes. In this review, epidemiology, presentation, macroscopic and microscopic features, and clinical prognostic and therapeutic implications of the major subgroups are described.

Consecutive patients older than 16 years, who initially visited department of gastroenterology at clinic of Peking University Third Hospital from May 9, 2012 to Dec 31, 2012, were required to complete a self-reported GERD questionnaire. Upper endoscopy was performed in some selected patients. A total of 18 987 patients were enrolled with a response rate of 91.5%. The prevalence of symptom-defined GERD was 13.6% (2 579/18 987). A total of 4 357 (22.9%) patients underwent the upper endoscopy, and the diagnostic rates of reflux esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, peptic ulcer disease, and upper gastrointestinal malignancy were 13.1% (572/4 357), 1.8% (78/4 357), 10.5% (456/4 357), and 1.7% (75/4 357), respectively. The incidence of reflux esophagitis was 22.7% (216/951) in patients with reflux symptoms and 10.5% (356/3 406) (P < 0.001) in patients without reflux symptoms, 2.7% (26/951) and 1.5% (52/3 406), respectively (P = 0.013) for Barrett's esophagus; 6.8% (65/951) and 11.5% (391/3 406), respectively (P < 0.001) for peptic ulcer disease; 1.7% (16/951) and 1.7% (59/3 406), respectively (P = 0.917) for upper gastrointestinal malignancy. GERD is one of the major diseases at gastroenterology clinic. Typical reflux symptoms suggest a diagnosis of GERD. But some patients with peptic ulcer disease or upper gastrointestinal malignancy can also present typical reflux symptoms. Upper endoscopy is valuable to avoid the misdiagnosis of other disorders.\",\n",

Immediately after admission, skin sclerosis rapidly extended to the neck and trunk, and subcutaneous tumors developed on the neck, chest and back. Skin sclerosis was prominent at the sites where subcutaneous tumors were present. The tumors were diagnosed as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of T-cell phenotype derived from soft tissue. Following 4 cycles of chemotherapy, he had complete remission and the skin sclerosis remarkably improved.

       "  'Abstract': 'We investigate the ground state and excitations of finite-size Heisenberg loops doped with one hole as the simplest example to illustrate the nature of strong correlations in a doped Mott insulator. We show that the doped hole form a peculiar long-range entanglement with the surrounding spins as revealed by inspecting the mutual correlations between the charge and spin using exact diagonalization (ED). In particular, the one-hole ground state acquires a series of non-trivial total momenta depending on the ratio J/t (J and t denote the superexchange coupling and hopping integral, respectively), which gives rise to distinct quantum phases separated by critical points (CPs). Interestingly the novel total momentum and correlations completely disappear once a singular sign structure is turned off in the t-J model, indicating the latter is the true original source for strong correlation via many-body quantum interference. We emphasize that the novelties discovered here are not restricted to the one-dimensional loop. We introduce a new charge-spin mutual entanglement that can well characterize these exotic properties, which can be then easily generalized to more realistic situations like two dimensions.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disorder that is characterized by aberrant tissue remodeling and the formation of fibroblastic foci that are composed of fibrogenic myofibroblasts. TGF-β1 is one of the factors that are responsible for fibrosis as it promotes fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) and is associated with up-regulation of α-smooth muscle actin. Therefore, inhibition of FMD may represent an effective strategy for the treatment of IPF. Here, we describe the treatment of human lung fibroblasts (WI-38 and HFL-1 cells) with cyclosporine A (CsA), which reduces TGF-β1-induced FMD <i>via</i> degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). In addition, in primary myofibroblast-like cells that were obtained from a patient with pulmonary fibrosis, treatment with CsA and an HIF-1α inhibitor (HIFi) decreased the expression levels of α-smooth muscle actin and fibronectin, which indicated that CsA and HIFi promote dedifferentiation of myofibroblasts. In mice intratracheally administered CsA or HIFi at an early fibrotic stage [7, 8, and 9 d postinstillation (dpi) of bleomycin], marked alleviation of lung fibrosis was observed at 14 dpi. These results suggest that CsA exhibits antifibrotic effects by degrading HIF-1α and that the CsA-HIF-1α axis provides new insights into therapeutic options for the treatment of IPF.-Yamazaki, R., Kasuya, Y., Fujita, T., Umezawa, H., Yanagihara, M., Nakamura, H., Yoshino, I., Tatsumi, K., Murayama, T.

       "  'Abstract': 'O-linked β-N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is an essential and ubiquitous post-translational modification present in nucleic and cytoplasmic proteins of multicellular eukaryotes. The metabolic chemical probes such as GlcNAc or GalNAc analogues bearing ketone or azide handles, in conjunction with bioorthogonal reactions, provide a powerful approach for detecting and identifying this modification. However, these chemical probes either enter multiple glycosylation pathways or have low labeling efficiency. Therefore, selective and potent probes are needed to assess this modification. We report here the development of a novel probe, 1,3,6-tri-O-acetyl-2-azidoacetamido-2,4-dideoxy-d-glucopyranose (Ac<sub>3</sub>4dGlcNAz), that can be processed by the GalNAc salvage pathway and transferred by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) to O-GlcNAc proteins. Due to the absence of a hydroxyl group at C4, this probe is less incorporated into α/β 4-GlcNAc or GalNAc containing glycoconjugates. Furthermore, the O-4dGlcNAz modification was resistant to the hydrolysis of O-GlcNAcase (OGA), which greatly enhanced the efficiency of incorporation for O-GlcNAcylation. Combined with a click reaction, Ac<sub>3</sub>4dGlcNAz allowed the selective visualization of O-GlcNAc in cells and accurate identification of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins with LC-MS/MS. This probe represents a more potent and selective tool in tracking, capturing, and identifying O-GlcNAc-modified proteins in cells and cell lysates.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Neoplastic urothelium has the capacity to display enormous plasticity and divergent differentiation. Neuroendocrine tumors arise as a result of such capacity. Neuroendocrine tumors of the bladder represent a limited number of neoplasms characterized by neuroendocrine hormone secretion and a poor outcome. These tumors can be displayed as pure neuroendocrine neoplasms or more frequently as a neuroendocrine counterpart mixed with classical urothelial bladder cell carcinomas, adenocarcinoma, sarcomatoid carcinoma or mixtures of these components. Their heterogeneous character and clinical aggressiveness remain a challenge for clinical, pathological diagnosis and for therapy selection. Several types have been described, although small cell carcinoma represents the major subgroup of neuroendocrine tumors as compared to large cell carcinoma and carcinoid subtypes. In this review, epidemiology, presentation, macroscopic and microscopic features, and clinical prognostic and therapeutic implications of the major subgroups are described. Special focus is given to discuss how immunohistochemistry protein patterns and laboratory determinations may aid to characterize this type of tumors and to improve the clinical management of this highly aggressive type of bladder cancer patients.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Although the risk of cancer progression in a Barrett's esophagus (BE) is very low, worrying about cancer is known as an important factor affecting HRQoL. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of BE patients with high levels of worry for cancer, to compare outcomes of patients endoscopically treated for BE neoplasia (DBE), non-dysplastic BE patients (NDBE) and patients with reflux symptoms, and to examine associated factors. We performed a cross sectional, exploratory, self-administered questionnaire study using the cancer worry scale, and the reflux disease questionnaire. A total of 192 DBE patients, 213 NDBE patients and 111 refractory reflux symptom patients were included from October 2019 until July 2021, 76.8% of BE participants were male and aged 66.9\\xa0years. High cancer worry was reported in 40.6% of the DBE patients and 36.2% of NDBE patient. Reflux patients scored statistically significant worse with 56.6% stated high cancer worry. Positive correlations were found between reflux symptoms and cancer worry in NDBE patients and reflux patients. In DBE patients' negative correlations were found between higher cancer worry and younger age as well as a family history of esophageal carcinoma. A clinically significant group of BE patients reported high cancer worry, which was associated with reflux symptoms in NDBE patients and a younger age and a (family) history of esophageal carcinoma diagnosis in BE patients treated for (early) neoplasia. Physicians should communicate about the actual cancer risk, which leads to greater patient understanding and therefore may have a positive impact on health outcomes.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Sleeve gastrectomy is the most commonly performed bariatric operation globally. The main complication is GERD. In the medium term, it can increase the incidence of Barrett's esophagus (BE), which is a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. Following conventional sleeve gastrectomy, BE is noted in up to 16% of patients postoperatively. Recently, Nissen sleeve gastrectomy (NSG) has been shown to reduce the frequency of postoperative GERD compared to conventional sleeve gastrectomy. This study aims to evaluate the impact of NSG on the incidence and remission of BE in the long term. This bicentric retrospective study included 692 patients who received NSG from September 2013 to July 2021. All patients underwent preoperative upper GI endoscopy and were then scheduled to receive upper GI endoscopy between 1 and 2\\xa0years and then between 3 and 5\\xa0years postoperatively. BE was systematically confirmed by biopsies. Seventy-four patients had endoscopic suspicion of BE, which was confirmed on 54/692 patients by histology. The BE lesions consisted of 18.5% intestinal metaplasia and 75.9% fundal metaplasia. Among these 54 patients, 38 underwent endoscopic investigation within 2\\xa0years postoperatively. The biopsies showed healed BE in 25/38 patients (64.1%). At 5\\xa0years, two patients had proven BE. Concerning the incidence of BE post NSG: 234 performed the follow-up endoscopy within 2\\xa0years. The incidence of de novo BE is nil. The NSG is associated with healing of known BE in approximately two-thirds of patients at 2-year follow-up. This is consistent with the GERD improvement that has been shown with NSG.\",\n",

Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for eighteen types of dietary intake were obtained from the UK Biobank. GWAS data for GERD, BE, and EC were sourced from the FinnGen consortium. We performed univariable and multivariable MR analysis to assess the cause effect between dietary factors and esophageal diseases. MR results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Raw vegetable intake was associated with a lower risk of GERD (OR = 0.478; P = 0.011). On the contrary, cooked vegetable intake increased the risk of GERD (OR = 1.911; P = 0.024). Bread intake was associated with increased odds of BE (OR = 6.754; P = 0.007), while processed meat intake was associated with reduced risk of BE (OR = 0.210; P = 0.035). We also observed evidence that increased consumption of dried fruit (OR = 0.087; P = 0.022) and salt added to food (OR = 0.346; P = 0.045) could prevent EC. The results of multivariable MR showed that the protective effect of consumption of salt added to food on EC was no longer significant after adjusting for the consumption of dried fruit. Vegetable consumption was associated with GERD, whereas consumption of bread and processed meat was associated with BE. Dried fruit intake was associated with a lower risk of EC, and the protective effect of consumption of salt added food on EC may also be mediated by consumption of dried fruit. Future research should be performed to investigate the mechanisms behind these cause-and-effect relationships to reduce the burden of disease caused by dietary habits.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Screening colonoscopy (SC) is widely accepted and has been shown to decrease the rate of colorectal cancer death. Guidelines and acceptance of screening for Barrett's esophagus (BE) are less established despite the fact that esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) remains the fastest increasing cancer in the USA. The aim of this study was to assess the timing and frequency of SC in patients ultimately found to have EA and to evaluate the presence of symptoms and risk factors that might have prompted an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and potentially earlier diagnosis of the EA. A retrospective chart review was performed to identify all patients who were referred to a single center with esophageal cancer between July 2016 and November 2022. Patients with any histology other than adenocarcinoma were excluded. There were 221 patients referred with EA. Of these, a SC had been done prior to the diagnosis of EA in 108 patients (49%): 96 men and 12 women. A total of 203 SC had been done (range 1-7 per patient), and 47% of patients had more than 1 SC. The median interval from the last SC to the diagnosis of EA was 2.9\\xa0years. At the time of SC, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms or chronic acid suppression medication use was reported by 81% of patients, and 80% had an American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) indication for a screening EGD. Only 19 patients (18%) that had a SC had an EGD at any time prior to the diagnosis of EA, and in these patients, 74% had erosive esophagitis or BE. The EA in most patients was stage III or IV and associated with lymph node metastases. Nearly one-half of patients ultimately diagnosed with EA had one or more SCs, and most of these patients had GERD symptoms, were using acid suppression medications or had an ASGE indication for a screening EGD. Despite this, only 18% had an EGD prior to the EA diagnosis. The addition of an EGD at the time of SC in these patients may have allowed the detection of BE or EA at an early, endoscopically curable stage and represents a missed opportunity to intervene in the natural history of this disease.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Recent reports have demonstrated that cannabinoid receptor binding decreases in several neurodegenerative diseases related to extrapyramidal function. However, there is little evidence with regard to potential changes of these receptors during senescence. The present study was designed to determine the possible existence of ageing-induced changes in cannabinoid receptor binding and gene expression in extrapyramidal areas. To this end, we analysed cannabinoid receptor binding and basal and cannabinoid receptor agonist-stimulated [35S]guanylyl-5'-O-(gamma-thio)-triphosphate binding, by using autoradiography, and cannabinoid receptor messenger RNA levels, by using in situ hybridization, in slide-mounted brain sections obtained from young (three-month-old) and aged (>two-year-old) rats. Results were as follows. Aged rats exhibited a marked decrease in cannabinoid receptor binding in most of the basal ganglia, excepting the globus pallidus which had similar binding levels in both young and aged rats. The highest decreases were in the entopeduncular nucleus (-49.6%) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (-45.2%), whereas more moderate decreases were found in the lateral caudate putamen (-29%) and only a decremental trend in the medial caudate putamen (-13.1%). These decreases in cannabinoid receptor binding were paralleled by less marked increases in WIN 55212-2-stimulated [35S]guanylyl-5'-O-(gamma-thio)-triphosphate binding in these structures in aged rats (% of agonist stimulation: 189% in the substantia nigra; 29.4% in the lateral caudate putamen) as compared to young rats (296% and 53.2%, respectively). Contrarily, the percentage of agonist stimulation was similar in the globus pallidus, an area where cannabinoid receptor binding did not change during ageing, of aged (205.5%) and young (215.5%) rats. In addition, aged rats also exhibited significant reductions in the cannabinoid receptor messenger RNA levels in the medial (-14.3%) and, in particular, in the lateral (-29.4%) caudate putamen, the area where the cell bodies of cannabinoid receptor-containing neurons, projecting to the substantia nigra, entopeduncular nucleus and globus pallidus, are located. In summary, the synthesis and binding levels of cannabinoid receptors markedly dropped in different structures of the extrapyramidal system of aged rats. Since these receptors, located in the basal ganglia, seem to play a role in motor control, this loss of cannabinoid receptors might be related to the motor impairment which progressively appears during senescence.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The distribution and density of cannabinoid receptor binding and messenger RNA expression in aged human brain were examined in several forebrain and basal ganglia structures. In vitro binding of [3H]CP-55,940, a synthetic cannabinoid, was examined by autoradiography in fresh frozen brain sections from normal aged humans (n = 3), patients who died with Alzheimer's disease (n = 5) and patients who died with other forms of cortical pathology (n = 5). In the structures examined--hippocampal formation, neocortex, basal ganglia and parts of the brainstem--receptor binding showed a characteristic pattern of high densities in the dentate gyrus molecular layer, globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata, moderate densities in the hippocampus, neocortex, amygdala and striatum, and low densities in the white matter and brainstem. In situ hybridization histochemistry of human cannabinoid receptor, a ribonucleotide probe for the human cannabinoid receptor messenger RNA, showed a pattern of extremely dense transcript levels in subpopulations of cells in the hippocampus and cortex, moderate levels in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and neurons of the striatum, amygdala and hypothalamus, and no signal over dentate gyrus granule cells and most of the cells of the thalamus and upper brainstem, including the substantia nigra. In Alzheimer's brains, compared to normal brains, [3H]CP-55,940 binding was reduced by 37-45% in all of the subfields of the hippocampal formation and by 49% in the caudate. Lesser reductions (20-24%) occurred in the substantia nigra and globus pallidus, internal segment. Other neocortical and basal ganglia structures were not different from control levels. Levels of messenger RNA expression did not differ between Alzheimer's and control brains, but there were regionally discrete statistically significant losses of the intensely expressing cells in the hippocampus. The reductions in binding did not correlate with or localize to areas showing histopathology, estimated either on the basis of overall tissue quality or silver staining of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Reduced [3H]55,940 binding was associated with increasing age and with other forms of cortical pathology, suggesting that receptor losses are related to the generalized aging and/or disease process and are not selectively associated with the pathology characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, nor with overall decrements in levels of cannabinoid receptor gene expression.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Cadmium (Cd) is hazardous to human health because of its cytotoxicity and long biological half-life. Azoramide is a small molecular agent that targets the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and moderates the unfolded protein response. However, its role in Cd-induced cytotoxicity remains unclear. This study was performed to investigate the protective effect of azoramide against Cd-induced cytotoxicity and elucidate its underlying mechanisms. Inductively coupled plasma‒mass spectrometry was used to measure Cd concentrations in each tissue of ICR male mice. The human proximal tubule epithelial cell line HK-2 and the human retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19 were used in the <i>in vitro</i> study. Cell apoptosis was determined by DAPI staining, JC-1 staining, and annexin V/propidium iodide double staining. Intracellular oxidative stress was detected by MitoSOX red staining, western blot, and quantitative real-time PCR. Moreover, ER stress signaling, MAPK cascades, and autophagy signaling were analyzed by western blot. The present data showed that Cd accumulated in various organs of ICR mice, and the concentrations of Cd in the studied organs, from high to low, were as follows: liver > kidney > testis > lung > spleen > eye. Our study demonstrated that azoramide inhibited ER stress by promoting BiP expression and suppressing the PERK-eIF2α-CHOP pathway. Additionally, we also found that azoramide significantly decreased ER stress-associated radical oxidative species production, attenuated p38 MAPK and JNK signaling, and inhibited autophagy, thus suppressing apoptosis in HK-2 and ARPE-19 cells. Our study investigated the effect of azoramide on Cd-induced cytotoxicity and revealed that azoramide may be a therapeutic drug for Cd poisoning.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease whose main pathological features are the degeneration of dopamine neurons and deposition of α-synuclein in neurons. At present, the most important treatment strategy for PD is drugs, and one of the most used drugs is levodopa. However, this therapy shows many problems, such as tolerance and long-term effects, so other treatment strategies need to be explored. As a traditional Chinese medicine treatment method with effective and few side effects, electroacupuncture is considered a non-drug therapy. It serves as a novel, promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of PD. In this review, the application and the effects of electroacupuncture on PD have been described. Besides, the underlying molecular mechanisms of electroacupuncture on PD that contribute to protecting dopaminergic neurons and reducing α-synuclein levels have been illustrated, including ① anti-oxidant stress response, ② anti-neuroinflammatory response, ③ up-regulation of neurotrophic factors and reduction of nerve cell apoptosis, ④ down-regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and improvement of mitochondrial function, ⑤ improvement of the function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, ⑥ anti-excitatory toxicity response, ⑦ activation of autophagy, and ⑧ modulation of gut microbiota. Achieving a better understanding of the neuroprotective effects of electroacupuncture on PD will provide a theoretical basis and facilitate the application of electroacupuncture on PD.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The term glaucoma encompasses various neurodegenerative eye disorders, among which the most common is primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Recently, the essential role of human retinal astrocytes (HRA) in glaucoma progression has been placed in the spotlight. It has been found that placing the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) under stress and activating PERK leads to apoptosis of HRA cells, which inhibits their neuroprotective effect in the course of glaucoma. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the small-molecule PERK inhibitor LDN-0060609 in countering ER stress conditions induced in HRA cells in vitro. The activity of LDN-0060609 was studied in terms of protein and mRNA expression, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, caspase-3 level and cell cycle progression. LDN-0060609 at 25 μM proved to be a potent inhibitor of the major PERK substrate, p-eIF2α (49% inhibition). The compound markedly decreased the expression of pro-apoptotic ER stress-related genes (<i>ATF4</i>, <i>DDIT3</i>, <i>BAX</i> and <i>Bcl-2</i>). Treatment with LDN-0060609 significantly increased cell viability, decreased genotoxicity and caspase-3 levels, and restored cell cycle distribution in HRA cells with activated ER stress conditions. These findings indicate that the small-molecule PERK inhibitor LDN-0060609 can potentially be developed into a novel anti-glaucoma agent.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Due to various factors, there is still a lack of effective neuroprotective agents for ischemic stroke in clinical practice. Neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress are some of the important pathological mechanisms in ischemic stroke. Linarin has been reported to have anti-inflammation, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects in myocardial ischemia, osteoarthritis, and kidney disease. Whether it exerts neuroprotective functions in ischemic stroke has not been investigated. The results showed that linarin could reduce the infarct volume in cerebral ischemia animal models, improve the neurological function scores and suppress the expression of inflammatory factors mediating the NF-κB. Meanwhile, it could protect the neurons from OGD/R-induced-apoptosis, which was related to the PERK-eIF2α pathway. Our results suggested linarin could inhibit neuronal inflammation and apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effect of linarin may be related to the inhibition of AKR1B1. Our study offers new insight into protecting against ischemia-reperfusion injury by linarin treatment in stroke.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"DAB(389)IL-2 (denileukin diftitox, ONTAK) is an interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R)-specific ligand fusion protein that may potentially be selective for IL-2R-expressing malignancies. The activity of DAB(389)IL-2 in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma has established the feasibility of utilizing such a targeted therapeutic in disseminated disease with acceptable toxicity. Data from the phase I trial suggest that the definition of activity in other cancer types, including other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), is warranted. Three NHL patients in this study responded, two of whom had follicular lymphomas, with the third having a primary intermediate-grade B-cell NHL that was refractory to chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. This patient has remained in complete remission over 3 years after treatment with DAB(389)IL-2. Patients treated to date have had IL-2R-positive tumors, but this remains a very complex clinical issue. The need for a threshold level of receptor expression, the difficulty in obtaining representative tissue, the lack of an assay that accurately reflects high-affinity receptor, and the potential difficulty of observer variability in evaluating the assays should point us toward examining response rates in cancer patients where IL-2R cannot be detected or is unknown. The potential to target the high-affinity IL-2R supports the development of this agent in transplantation and in autoimmune diseases. Targeting IL-2R-expressing lymphocytes may be an effective strategy for the prevention of graft rejection and to treat or prevent graft-versus-host disease. DAB(389)IL-2 has been examined in clinical trials of psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis and has shown promising results. The potential utility in other autoimmune disorders is unknown, but diseases such as systemic lupus, scleroderma, and vasculitis also may be effective candidates for such ligand fusion therapy.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disorder that is characterized by aberrant tissue remodeling and the formation of fibroblastic foci that are composed of fibrogenic myofibroblasts. TGF-β1 is one of the factors that are responsible for fibrosis as it promotes fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) and is associated with up-regulation of α-smooth muscle actin. Therefore, inhibition of FMD may represent an effective strategy for the treatment of IPF. Here, we describe the treatment of human lung fibroblasts (WI-38 and HFL-1 cells) with cyclosporine A (CsA), which reduces TGF-β1-induced FMD <i>via</i> degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). In addition, in primary myofibroblast-like cells that were obtained from a patient with pulmonary fibrosis, treatment with CsA and an HIF-1α inhibitor (HIFi) decreased the expression levels of α-smooth muscle actin and fibronectin, which indicated that CsA and HIFi promote dedifferentiation of myofibroblasts. In mice intratracheally administered CsA or HIFi at an early fibrotic stage [7, 8, and 9 d postinstillation (dpi) of bleomycin], marked alleviation of lung fibrosis was observed at 14 dpi. These results suggest that CsA exhibits antifibrotic effects by degrading HIF-1α and that the CsA-HIF-1α axis provides new insights into therapeutic options for the treatment of IPF.-Yamazaki, R., Kasuya, Y., Fujita, T., Umezawa, H., Yanagihara, M., Nakamura, H., Yoshino, I., Tatsumi, K., Murayama, T.

       "  'Abstract': 'Prostate cancer (PC) is successfully treated with anti-androgens; however, a significant proportion of patients develop resistance against this therapy. Anti-androgen-resistant disease (castration-resistant prostate cancer; CRPC) is currently incurable. Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is positioned to positively regulate both cell cycle and transcription, the two features critical for the rapid proliferation of the CRPC cells. Here, we assess if CDK7 is a viable target to halt the proliferation of CRPC cells. We use recently developed clinically relevant compounds targeting CDK7 and multiple cell proliferation assays to probe the importance of this kinase for the proliferation of normal, androgen-dependent, and CRPC cells. PC patient data were used to evaluate expression of CDK7 at different disease-stages. Finally, comprehensive glycoproteome-profiling was performed to evaluate CDK7 inhibitor effects on androgen-dependent and CRPC cells. We show that CDK7 is overexpressed in PC patients with poor prognosis, and that CRPC cells are highly sensitive to compounds targeting CDK7. Inhibition of O-GlcNAc transferase sensitizes the CRPC, but not androgen-dependent PC cells, to CDK7 inhibitors. Glycoproteome-profiling revealed that CDK7 inhibition induces hyper-O-GlcNAcylation of the positive transcription elongation complex (pTEFB: CDK9 and CCNT1) in the CRPC cells. Accordingly, co-targeting of CDK7 and CDK9 synergistically blocks the proliferation of the CRPC cells but does not have anti-proliferative effects in the normal prostate cells. We show that CRPC cells, but not normal prostate cells, are addicted on the high activity of the key transcriptional kinases, CDK7 and CDK9.',\n",

We developed an original tool, enabling labeling and visualization of the cell cycle key-regulator β-catenin in its <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylated form, based on intramolecular Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) technology in cells. We opted for a bioorthogonal chemical reporter strategy based on the dual-labeling of β-catenin with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) for protein sequence combined with a chemically-clicked imaging probe for PTM, resulting in a fast and easy to monitor qualitative FRET assay. We validated this technology by imaging the <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation status of β-catenin in HeLa cells.

       "  'Title': 'Antisense targeting of decoy exons can reduce intron retention and increase protein expression in human erythroblasts.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': \"The decoy exon model has been proposed to regulate a subset of intron retention (IR) events involving predominantly larger introns (>1 kb). Splicing reporter studies have shown that decoy splice sites are essential for activity, suggesting that decoys act by engaging intron-terminal splice sites and competing with cross-intron interactions required for intron excision. The decoy model predicts that antisense oligonucleotides may be able to block decoy splice sites in endogenous pre-mRNA, thereby reducing IR and increasing productive gene expression. Indeed, we now demonstrate that targeting a decoy 5' splice site in the O-GlcNAc transferase (<i>OGT</i>) gene reduced IR from ∼80% to ∼20% in primary human erythroblasts, accompanied by increases in spliced <i>OGT</i> RNA and OGT protein expression. The remaining <i>OGT</i> IR was refractory to antisense treatment and might be mediated by independent mechanism(s). In contrast, other retained introns were strongly dependent on decoy function, since antisense targeting of decoy 5' splice sites greatly reduced (<i>SNRNP70</i>) or nearly eliminated (<i>SF3B1</i>) IR in two widely expressed splicing factors, and also greatly reduced IR in transcripts encoding the erythroid-specific structural protein, α-spectrin (<i>SPTA1</i>). These results show that modulating decoy exon function can dramatically alter IR and suggest that dynamic regulation of decoy exons could be a mechanism to fine-tune gene expression post-transcriptionally in many cell types.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'O-GlcNAcylation of ITGA5 facilitates the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Integrin α5 (ITGA5) as one member of integrins family, plays an important role in promoting cancer cell metastasis and invasion through inducing the communications among different cells or cells with extracellular matrix (ECM). However, the mechanisms underlying ITGA5 in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression need to be explored, especially for its O-GlcNAcylation. To this end, the current study was performed to explore the effects of O-GlcNAcylation on ITGA5 expression, as well as to probe the effects of ITGA5 O-GlcNAcylation on CRC progression. The expression profiles of ITGA5, OGT and O-GlcNAc in CRC tissues and cells were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), RT-PCR and western blotting. CCK-8, flow cytometry and xenotransplantation assays were used to assess cell growth, apoptosis and tumorigenesis. Immunoprecipitation (IP), in vitro O-GlcNAcylation of ITGA5 and enzymatic labelling of O-GlcNAc assays were used to detect the O-GlcNAcylation of ITGA5 protein. The expression of ITGA5, OGT and O-GlcNAc were all elevated in CRC tissues and cells compared with the normal tissues and cells. Up-regulation of ITGA5 in CRC RKO cells enhanced cell growth and tumorigenesis while decreased cell apoptosis, while down-regulation of ITGA5 in CRC SW620\\xa0cells decreased cell growth and tumorigenesis and induced cell apoptosis. Besides, PUGNAc, GlcN or PUGNAc\\xa0+\\xa0GlcNAc treatment increased ITGA5 protein expression in RKO and SW620\\xa0cells, as well as increased its protein stability via enhancing its O-GlcNAcylation. Collectively, the present study makes clear that ITGA5 overexpression accelerates the progression of CRC, which is closely associated to its enhanced O-GlcNAcylation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is overexpressed in aggressive prostate cancer. OGT modifies intra-cellular proteins via single sugar conjugation (O-GlcNAcylation) to alter their activity. We recently discovered the first fast-acting OGT inhibitor OSMI-2. Here, we probe the stability and function of the chromatin O-GlcNAc and identify transcription factors that coordinate with OGT to promote proliferation of prostate cancer cells. <b>Methods</b>: Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled to sequencing (seq), formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements, RNA-seq and reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPA) were used to study the importance of OGT for chromatin structure and transcription. Mass spectrometry, western blot, RT-qPCR, cell cycle analysis and viability assays were used to establish the role of OGT for MYC-related processes. Prostate cancer patient data profiled for both mRNA and protein levels were used to validate findings. <b>Results</b>: We show for the first time that OGT inhibition leads to a rapid loss of O-GlcNAc chromatin mark. O-GlcNAc ChIP-seq regions overlap with super-enhancers (SE) and MYC binding sites. OGT inhibition leads to down-regulation of SE-dependent genes. We establish the first O-GlcNAc chromatin consensus motif, which we use as a bait for mass spectrometry. By combining the proteomic data from oligonucleotide enrichment with O-GlcNAc and MYC ChIP-mass spectrometry, we identify host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) as an interaction partner of MYC. Inhibition of OGT disrupts this interaction and compromises MYC's ability to confer androgen-independent proliferation to prostate cancer cells. We show that OGT is required for MYC-mediated stabilization of mitotic proteins, including Cyclin B1, and/or the increased translation of their coding transcripts. This implies that increased expression of mRNA is not always required to achieve increased protein expression and confer aggressive phenotype. Indeed, high expression of Cyclin B1 protein has strong predictive value in prostate cancer patients (p=0.000014) while mRNA does not. <b>Conclusions</b>: OGT promotes SE-dependent gene expression. OGT activity is required for the interaction between MYC and HCF-1 and expression of MYC-regulated mitotic proteins. These features render OGT essential for the androgen-independent, MYC-driven proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Androgen-independency is the major mechanism of prostate cancer progression, and our study identifies OGT as an essential mediator in this process.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'Molecular pathology of the luminal class of urothelial tumors.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Molecular subtypes of urothelial carcinoma may be divided into luminal and nonluminal tumors. Nonluminal tumors are composed of cases with basal/squamous-like or small cell/neuroendocrine features, with a consensus on the molecular characteristics of the respective subtype. In contrast, luminal tumors are more disparate with three to five suggested subtypes and with definitions that do not always cohere. To resolve some of these disparities we assembled a cohort of 344 luminal tumors classified as urothelial-like (Uro), with the subtypes UroA, UroAp, UroB, and UroC, or genomically unstable (GU) according to the LundTax system. Cases were systematically analyzed by immunohistochemistry using antibodies for proteins representing important biological processes or cellular states: KRT5, EGFR, and CDH3 for the integrity of a basal cell layer; CCNB1, Ki67, and FOXM1 for proliferation; FGFR3 and ERBB2 for receptor tyrosine kinase status; CCND1, CDKN2A(p16), RB1, and E2F3 for cell cycle regulation; PPARG, GATA3, and TP63 for the differentiation regulatory system; and KRT20 and UPK3 for the differentiation readout. We show that Uro tumors form one, albeit heterogenous, group characterized by FGFR3, CCND1, and RB1 expression, but low or absence of CDKN2A(p16) and ERBB2 expression. The opposite expression pattern is observed in GU cases. Furthermore, Uro tumors are distinguished from GU tumors by showing a high RB1/p16 expression ratio. Class defining characteristics were independent of pathological stage and growth pattern, and thus intrinsic. In Uro tumors, proliferation was limited to a well-defined single layer of basal-like cells in UroA tumors but occurred throughout the tumor parenchyma, independent of the basal layer, in the more progressed UroAp and UroC tumors. A similar change in proliferation topology was not observed in GU. We conclude that luminal urothelial carcinomas consist, at the molecular pathology level, of two major subtypes, the larger heterogenous Uro and the biologically distinct GU subtype. © 2019 The Authors.

       "  'Abstract': 'Neuroendocrine (NE) bladder carcinoma is a rare and aggressive variant. Molecular subtyping studies have found that 5% to 15% of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) have transcriptomic patterns consistent with NE bladder cancer in the absence of NE histology. The clinical implications of this NE-like subtype have not been explored in depth. Transcriptome-wide expression profiles were generated for MIBC collected from 7 institutions and clinical-use of Decipher Bladder. Using unsupervised clustering, we generated a clustering solution on a prospective training cohort (PTC; <i>n</i> = 175), developed single-sample classifiers to predict NE tumors, and evaluated the resultant models on a testing radical cystectomy (RC) cohort (<i>n</i> = 225). A random forest model was finalized and applied to 5 validation cohorts (<i>n</i> = 1302). Uni- and multivariable survival analyses were used to characterize clinical outcomes. In the training cohort (PTC), hierarchical clustering using an 84-gene panel showed a cluster of 8 patients (4.6%) with highly heterogeneous expression of NE markers in the absence of basal or luminal marker expression. NE-like tumors were identified in 1% to 6.6% of cases in validation cohorts. Patients with NE-like tumors had significantly worse 1-year progression-free survival (65% NE-like vs. 82% overall; <i>P</i> = 0.046) and, after adjusting for clinical and pathologic factors, had a 6.4-fold increased risk of all-cause mortality (<i>P</i> = 0.001). IHC confirmed the neuronal character of these tumors. A single-patient classifier was developed that identifies patients with histologic urothelial cancer harboring a NE transcriptomic profile.

The patients included 69 men and 12 women with a mean age of 68\\u202fyears. Most bladder SmCCs were presented at advanced stage, with tumors invading the muscularis propria and beyond (n\\u202f=\\u202f77). SmCC was pure in 27 cases and mixed with other histologic types in 54 cases, including urothelial carcinoma (UC) (n\\u202f=\\u202f32), UC in situ (n\\u202f=\\u202f26), glandular (n\\u202f=\\u202f14), micropapillary (n\\u202f=\\u202f4), sarcomatoid (n\\u202f=\\u202f4), squamous (n\\u202f=\\u202f3), and plasmacytoid (n\\u202f=\\u202f1) features. Most SmCCs expressed neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin (41/56), chromogranin (26/55), and CD56 (39/41); however, they did not express UC luminal markers CK20 (0/17), GATA3 (1/30), and uroplakin II (1/22). Some SmCCs showed focal expression of CK5/6 (9/25), a marker for the basal molecular subtype. Furthermore, expression of the retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) gene protein was lost in most of the bladder SmCCs (2/23). The patients' survival was significantly associated with cancer stage but did not show a significant difference between mixed and pure SmCCs. Compared with conventional UC at similar stages, SmCC had a worse prognosis only when patients developed metastatic diseases. In conclusion, bladder SmCC is an aggressive disease that is frequently present at an advanced stage. A fraction of SmCCs show a basal molecular subtype, which may underlie its good response to chemotherapy. Inactivation of the RB1 gene may be implicated in the oncogenesis of bladder SmCC.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Through analysis and summarization of clinicopathological features, immunohistochemical expression, pathological diagnostic criteria, prognostic and other factors in patients suffering from bladder neuroendocrine carcinoma (BNEC), a better understanding of BNEC could be achieved to provide solid evidence for clinicopathology and prognosis. The clinicopathological data of 39 cases of BNEC with up to 5-year follow-up data (median follow-up=650 days) were analyzed retrospectively based on immunohistochemical staining. Survival analyses were carried out using the Kaplan-Meier method and tested with the log-rank method. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was adopted to screen independent risk factors affecting patients' survival. In these 39 cases of BNEC, there were 26 cases of male patients, 13 female, with the proportion of male to female being 2:1. The ages of onset ranged from 44 to 86, with the median age being 62 and the average age 61.97 years, respectively. Histologically, referring to the WHO standard of neuroendocrine lung tumor classification, there were 7 cases of typical carcinoid tumors, 8 atypical carcinoid, 12 small-cell carcinomas and 12 large-cell carcinomas. In these cases there were 11 cases of featured urothelium carcinomas and 9 cases of adenocarcinomas. Immunohistochemical staining showed that, in these 39 cases of BNEC, the positive expression for the neuroendocrinic markers, including neural cell adhesion molecule 56 (CD56), synaptophysin (Syn), chromogranin A (CgA), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), cytokeratin (CK) and cytokeratin 7 (CK7), accounted for 39/39, 27/39, 18/39, 39/39, 19/39, 10/39 and 8/39, respectively. In contrast, cytokeratin 20 (CK20), protein 63 (P63), human melanoma black 45 (HMB45), S-lfln protein 100 (S-100) and leukocyte common antigen (LCA) were all negatively expressed. During the follow-up period, 12 patients died. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 76.92%, 74.36% and 69.23%. BNEC is one of the most malignant tumors with severe invasiveness and poor prognosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed that CD56, Syn, CgA, NSE, TTF-1, CK, CK7, CK20, P63, HMB45, S-100 protein and LCA immune markers play important roles in diagnosis and differentiation. Many factors, including the patient's age, size and shape of the tumor, operative method, perineuronal invasion, vascular invasion, distant organ metastasis and pathological type, show great difference in influencing OS time of patients, among which the size of the tumor, no invasion, vascular invasion and distant organ metastasis are independent risk factors affecting prognosis (survival time). Radical cystectomy is the prior alternative to treat this tumor.\",\n",
